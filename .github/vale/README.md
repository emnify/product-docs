# Vale

emnify uses [Vale](https://vale.sh/) to enforce consistency in the documentation.

Vale is an open source command-line tool to provide English language linting.
Vale enables spell checking, writing improvements, and style guide enforcement in files across text and code.

Vale uses packages, also known as [Styles](#styles), to define the set of rules for writing to follow.

## Install Vale

Follow the instructions on the Vale website to [install the Vale command-line tool](https://vale.sh/docs/vale-cli/installation/).

## Run Vale

Once you have Vale installed, you can run it locally using `vale <path to document>`.

For example, if you run the following example at the project root, it lints this file:

```shell
vale .github/vale/README.md
```

### Alerts

Vale has three alert options: `suggestion`, `warning`, and `error`.
emnify treats warnings and errors the same. 

<!-- All Vale tests must pass for approval. -->

> **Note** 
> This repository is being migrated to Vale, so it's currently not integrated into the commit hooks or CI pipelines.

## Styles

emnify uses the following [Vale Styles](https://vale.sh/docs/topics/styles/):

- [Vale](https://vale.sh/docs/topics/styles/#extension-points) (default linting)
- Google (for the [Google developer documentation style guide](https://developers.google.com/style))
- [alex](https://alexjs.com/) (for catching condescending language) 

> **Note** 
> emnify has made some modifications to these packages to remove duplicates or add emnify-specific terms.

## Vocabularies

Vale uses [Vocabularies](https://vale.sh/docs/topics/vocab/) to define term lists to further customize styles.
emnify uses this to define company or industry-specific terminology (see [`accept.txt`](./styles/Vocab/emnify/accept.txt) for the full list). 

## Ignore Vale rules

Vale can turn off [specific rules](#ignore-specific-rules) or [all rules](#ignore-all-rules) inside a document.
All ignored rules should include a justification for why theyâ€™re ignored.

> **Warning** 
> Vale ignores rules not turned back on for the rest of the document.
> After the ignored content, turn the rules back on.

## Ignore specific rules

Ignore a specific rule with `<!-- vale <rule name> = NO -->` and turn the rule back on with `<!-- vale <rule name> = YES -->`.

For example:

```markdown
<!-- vale Google.Contractions = NO -->
<!-- Turn off Google's default contractions rule for the example -->
Do not turn off rules without good reasons.
<!-- vale Google.Contractions = YES -->
```

> **Note** 
> Vale requires capitalization for `YES` and `NO` and a space around `=`.

### Ignore all rules

Use `<!-- vale off -->` to ignore all Vale rules and `<!-- vale on -->` to turn Vale back on.

For example:

```markdown
<!-- vale off -->
<!-- Turn off vale checking for this example -->
The following example will use passive voice and expansions. 
Do not do this.
<!-- vale on -->
```
