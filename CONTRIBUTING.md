## Style guide

All technical documentation at emnify follows the [Google developer documentation style guide](https://developers.google.com/style).
When in doubt, refer to this style guide as a resource.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This repository uses [Vale](.github/vale/README.md) to lint and enforce this style guide.

## File structure

- Names should be written in [kebab case](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/snake-case-vs-camel-case-vs-pascal-case-vs-kebab-case-whats-the-difference/#kebab-case) format with all lowercase characters.
- Use the `.mdx` extension whenever you use JSX or other MDX features (for example, `import` or `export`) inside a Markdown file.

> ![IMPORTANT]
> According to [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/blog/preparing-your-site-for-docusaurus-v3), future versions will parse `.md` files as standard [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/), which doesn't support these features.

## Admonitions

Admonitions (often called alerts) are an extension of the Markdown syntax used to emphasize critical information.
There are five types, each with a distinct purpose.

Inspired by [GitHub alerts](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/16925), here's how emnify uses each admonition type:

- **Note**: Highlights information that users should take into account, even when skimming.
- **Tip**: Optional information to help a user be more successful.
- **Info**: Crucial information necessary for users to succeed.
- **Caution**: Critical content demanding immediate user attention due to potential risks.
- **Danger**: Negative potential consequences of an action.

> ![TIP]
> See [Admonitions in the Docusaurus documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/admonitions) for more information about formatting and syntax.

## Images

Each category within the [`docs` directory](./docs/) has an `assets` directory containing all the infographics, screenshots, or other images used on those pages.

### File management tips

- Images shouldnâ€™t be larger than 100 KB.
- Filenames should be written in [kebab case](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/snake-case-vs-camel-case-vs-pascal-case-vs-kebab-case-whats-the-difference/#kebab-case) format with all lowercase characters.
  - Infographics should begin with `infographic-`
  - Screenshots should describe the part of the system represented from least to most specific (for example, a screenshot of the Data Streams section of the Integrations page in the emnify Portal should be named `portal-integrations-data-streams`)

### Annotate screenshots

Use a square or rectangle to indicate a specific area of interest within a screenshot.
For consistency, follow these guidelines:

- **Color**: 
  - Design token: `--eui-sys-support-primary-information` 
  - Current hex value: `#4377cd`
- **Corners**: Sharp, not rounded (`border-radius: 0;`)
- **Line thickness**: Roughly `8px`
