## Style guide

All technical documentation at emnify follows the [Google developer documentation style guide](https://developers.google.com/style).
When in doubt, refer to this style guide as a resource.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This repository uses [Vale](.github/vale/README.md) to lint and enforce this style guide.

## File structure

- Names should be written in [kebab case](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/snake-case-vs-camel-case-vs-pascal-case-vs-kebab-case-whats-the-difference/#kebab-case) format with all lowercase characters.
- Use the `.mdx` extension whenever you use JSX or other MDX features (for example, `import` or `export`) inside a Markdown file.

> ![IMPORTANT]
> According to [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/blog/preparing-your-site-for-docusaurus-v3), future versions will parse `.md` files as standard [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/), which doesn't support these features.

## Components

### Admonitions

Admonitions (often called alerts) are an extension of the Markdown syntax used to emphasize critical information.
There are five types, each with a distinct purpose.

Inspired by [GitHub alerts](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/16925), here's how emnify uses each admonition type:

- **Note**: Highlights information that users should take into account, even when skimming.
- **Tip**: Optional information to help a user be more successful.
- **Info**: Crucial information necessary for users to succeed.
- **Warning**: Critical content demanding immediate user attention due to potential risks.
- **Danger**: Negative potential consequences of an action.

> ![TIP]
> See [Admonitions in the Docusaurus documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/admonitions) for more information about formatting and syntax.

### Code blocks

The `react-prism-render` library is used for code block syntax highlighting.
From v2.0+, [less languages are included by default](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/prism-react-renderer/blob/prism-react-renderer%402.1.0/packages/generate-prism-languages/index.ts#L9).
If the language you need isn't listed, check the [Docusaurus configuration](https://github.com/emnify/product-docs/blob/main/docusaurus.config.js#L171) and add it if necessary.

### Partials

When pages contain repetitive content, you can extract the content into a "partial" and import it into other documents.

Each category with the [`docs` directory](./docs/) that uses partials has a `partials` directory containing the source files.
These files must use the `_` filename prefix (for example, `_config-instructions.mdx`) to bypass page creation and linting.
The imported component name should end with `Partial` (for example, `ConfigInstructionsPartial`).

> [!TIP]
> Learn more about [partials in Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/react#importing-markdown).

## Assets

Each category within the [`docs` directory](./docs/) has a co-located `assets` directory containing all the images and icons used on those pages.

> [!TIP]
> Learn more about [assets in Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/assets).

### Images

Images are screenshots, infographics, and other diagrams shown in the main documentation content.
[Icons](#icons) have a separate workflow.

To display images in the emnify documentation, use the custom [`Image`](./src/components/Image.jsx).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `srcPath` value should use the [inline CommonJS `require`](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/assets#images) (unless the image source is an external URL).

```jsx
<Image
  srcPath={require('./path/to/name-of-image.png').default}
  alt="Optional descriptive alt text for the image. Defaults to an empty attribute."
  modifiers="img--some-mod img--another-mod"
/>
```

> [!NOTE]
> You don't need to import the `Image` component because it's registered to the [global scope](./src/theme/MDXComponents.js).

#### SVGs

To apply the [docusaurus-plugin-image-zoom](https://github.com/gabrielcsapo/docusaurus-plugin-image-zoom) feature to an SVG file, you need to add `!!url-loader!` at the beginning of the asset pathâ€”otherwise, the [webpack `svg-loader` kicks in](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/8398#issuecomment-1331694452).

```jsx
<Image
  srcPath={require('!!url-loader!./assets/graphiql-logo.svg').default}
  alt="GraphiQL"
/>
```

### Icons

In most cases, use an [ES import statement](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/assets#images) to display icons in the emnify Documentation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Because of the [markdownlint configuration](./.markdownlint.jsonc), any import statements must be _after_ the top-level header.

Example of how to display images using ES `import` syntax and [inline SVGs](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/assets#inline-svgs):

```jsx
import Check from '../assets/check.svg';

<Check alt="Yes" />
```

### File management tips

- Images shouldnâ€™t be larger than 100 KB.
- Filenames should be written in [kebab case](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/snake-case-vs-camel-case-vs-pascal-case-vs-kebab-case-whats-the-difference/#kebab-case) format with all lowercase characters.
  - Infographics should begin with `infographic-`
  - Screenshots should describe the part of the system represented from least to most specific (for example, a screenshot of the Data Streams section of the Integrations page in the emnify Portal should be named `portal-integrations-data-streams`)

Depending on your operating system, you may run into an issue where your Git configuration doesn't catch subtle filename changes, resulting in a failing build.
To avoid this problem, update this setting:

```shell
git config core.ignoreCase false
```

### Annotate screenshots

Use a square or rectangle to indicate a specific area of interest within a screenshot.
For consistency, follow these guidelines:

- **Color**: 
  - Design token: `--eui-sys-support-primary-information` 
  - Current hex value: `#4377cd`
- **Corners**: Sharp, not rounded (`border-radius: 0;`)
- **Line thickness**: Roughly `8px`

## Validate MDX files

Docusaurus provides a [docusaurus-mdx-checker](https://github.com/slorber/docusaurus-mdx-checker) CLI to help spot problematic content that'll result in compilation errors.
To see what files fail to compile under MDX v3, run:

```bash
npx docusaurus-mdx-checker
```
