## Style guide

All technical documentation at emnify follows the [Google developer documentation style guide](https://developers.google.com/style).
When in doubt, refer to this style guide as a resource.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This repository uses [Vale](.github/vale/README.md) to lint and enforce this style guide.

## Images

Each category within the [`docs` directory](./docs/) has an `assets` directory containing all the infographics, screenshots, or other images used on those pages.

### File management tips

- Images shouldnâ€™t be larger than 100 KB.
- Filenames should be written in [kebab case](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/snake-case-vs-camel-case-vs-pascal-case-vs-kebab-case-whats-the-difference/#kebab-case) format with all lowercase characters.
  - Infographics should begin with `infographic-`
  - Screenshots should describe the part of the system represented from least to most specific (for example, a screenshot of the Data Streams section of the Integrations page in the emnify Portal should be named `portal-integrations-data-streams`)

### Annotate screenshots

Use a square or rectangle to indicate a specific area of interest within a screenshot.
For consistency, follow these guidelines:

- **Color**: 
  - Design token: `--eui-sys-support-primary-information` 
  - Current hex value: `#4377cd`
- **Corners**: Sharp, not rounded (`border-radius: 0;`)
- **Line thickness**: Roughly `8px`
