# Event types

The following is a list of available event types, including the corresponding IDs and descriptions. 

:::info
Some event types are only available for [MNO](https://www.emnify.com/iot-glossary/mno) and Reseller accounts, as they require additional authentication. 
You can find those events on the [MNO and Reseller events](mno-events) page.

## Generic events

| ID   | Description  |
| ---- | ------------ |
| 0    | [Generic](#generic) |

### Generic

Data session disconnected while applying the updated actions on the connectivity ([PDP sessions](#data-connection-lifecycle)) or the [updated quota information](#data-quota-management).

:::info
Other generic event triggers are possible. 

We're in the process of adding more specific event types that will replace these. 
We'll update this list as new event types are created.

## Network attachment and location

| ID   | Description  |
| ---- | ------------ |
| 1    | [Update location](#update-location) |
| 2    | [Update GPRS location](#update-gprs-location) |
| 15   | [Purge location](#purge-location) |
| 16   | [Purge GPRS location](#purge-gprs-location) |

### Update location

Device attached to a network when first switched on or moved to a new location. 
It can also periodically inform the network of the device's location.

**Example**: A SIM card has (re)authenticated with a different network element. 
If successful, the device will show as **Attached** in the [emnify Portal](usage#the-emnify-portal) and can already receive SMS.


### Update GPRS location

Used by the serving GPRS support node (SGSN) to update the device's location. 
The SGSN then uses that information to provide functionality switching, security, and authentication.

**Example**: A SIM card has successfully registered for data sessions with a different network element.


### Purge location

Device is unreachable or switched off, and the network doesn't know its location.

**Example**: The network deletes the routing information for a mobile-terminated call or mobile-terminated short message and marks the device not reachable.

### Purge GPRS location

Device is inactive and doesn't send or receive any packets.

## Data connection lifecycle  

| ID   | Description  |
| ---- | ------------ |
| 3    | [Create PDP Context](#create-pdp-context) |
| 5    | [Delete PDP Context](#delete-pdp-context) |
| 49   | [Device offline](#device-offline) |

### Create PDP Context

Activation (or rejection) of data connectivity. 

**Example**: A device has established a data session and started transferring data. 
This device will show as **Online** in the [emnify Portal](usage#the-emnify-portal) (as long as there hasn't been a subsequent [Delete PDP Context](#delete-pdp-context) event).


### Delete PDP Context

Data session between the device and the network is deleted. 

**Example**: A device disconnected and ended a data transfer. 
The event details will also show the data transmitted, and the device status will show as **Offline** in the [emnify Portal](usage#the-emnify-portal).

### Device offline

Device deleted a PDP context and doesn't create a new PDP context within 5 minutes. 

**Example**: A device is no longer attached to a network and hasn't tried to connect to a network for 24-48 hours.

| 51   | [SIM Assigned](#sim-assigned) | 

### SIM activation

The SIM is patched to the **Activated** status after previously holding one of the following statuses: 
**Issued**, **Suspended**, or **Factory Test**. 

:::note
Activated SIMs are able to use network services.
:::

### SIM suspension

The SIM is patched to the **Suspended** status, temporarily suspending and blocking it from network access. 

:::tip
Activating a SIM with the **Suspended** status again is possible at any time.
:::

### SIM deletion

The SIM is deleted and permanently removed from the SIM repository.

:::caution
Once deleted, the SIM cannot be restored for network access.
:::

### Endpoint enabled

Device is enabled.

### Endpoint disabled

Device is disabled.

### SIM factory test

### SIM registration

SIM or SIM batch is registered to an organization via a [Batch Identification Code (BIC)](https://www.emnify.com/developers/documentation#_glossary). 

:::note
This event doesn't trigger when the emnify team assigns SIMs to an organization. 
It also doesn't trigger for every SIM of a SIM batch, so the event log will only be visible on the individual SIM when registering single SIM batches.
:::

### SIM Released

SIM is released from a device. 

:::info
Triggered through the [emnify User Interface (EUI)](https://support.emnify.com/hc/en-us/sections/115000969189-EMnify-User-Interface-EUI-).
:::

### SIM Assigned

SIM is assigned to a device. 

:::info
Triggered through the [emnify User Interface (EUI)](https://support.emnify.com/hc/en-us/sections/115000969189-EMnify-User-Interface-EUI-) or while [creating an endpoint using the emnify REST API](https://cdn.emnify.net/api/doc/swagger.html#/Endpoint/CreateEndpoint).
:::

## Limit enforcement 

| ID   | Description  |     
| ---- | ------------ |

:::note API Reference
Quota information is in the [detail object](https://cdn.emnify.net/api/doc/event.html#detail-object) of the event.
:::

### Quota threshold reached

Remaining data quota volume fell below the configured threshold percentage. 
Exclusively for devices with enabled data quota management and a configured quota threshold percentage. 

:::note
The threshold percentage can be submitted when the data quota is assigned to the device.
:::

**Example**: If the device's data quota volume is set to 100 MB and the threshold percentage to 15%, the system will generate an event when the remaining volume falls below 15 MB.

### Quota used up

Data quota volume is completely depleted. 
Exclusively for devices with enabled data quota management. 

:::caution
Once this happens, the data quota status updates from **Active** to **Exhausted**, and the device won't be able to consume from the data service. 
Established connections for that device will disconnect within seconds, and new connection requests will be denied until a new data quota is assigned or data quota management is disabled on the service profile.
:::

### Data quota enabled

Data quota management is enabled on a service profile. 

:::caution
All devices using this service profile need to have an active data quota assigned to use the data service. 
Devices without active data quotas will disconnect within seconds. 
New connection requests will be denied until a new data quota is assigned or data quota management is disabled on the service profile.
:::

### Data quota disabled

:::

**Example**: A device has a quota volume of 50 MB with daily auto-refill enabled, valid until May 27, 2025, and action on exhaustion set to block. 
The event description will read: 
"Data quota got assigned with a volume of 50.000000 MB with daily refill till 2025-05-27T22:56:17Z. 
On exhaustion, the data service will be blocked.”
