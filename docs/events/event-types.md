# Event Types

The following is a list of available event types, including the corresponding IDs and descriptions. 

:::info
Some event types are only available for [MNO](https://www.emnify.com/iot-glossary/mno) and Reseller accounts, as they require additional authentication. You can find those events on the [MNO and Reseller Events](mno-events) page.

## Generic Events

| ID   | Description  |
| ---- | ------------ |
| 0    | [Generic](#generic) |

### Generic
Data session disconnects while applying the updated actions on the connectivity ([PDP sessions](#data-connection-lifecycle)) or the [updated quota information](#quota-management).


## Network Attachment and Location

| ID   | Description  |
| ---- | ------------ |
| 1    | Update location |
| 2    | Update GPRS location |
| 15   | Purge location |
| 16   | Purge GPRS location |

### Update location

Registers the device location when it's first switched on and attaches to a network or updates the device location when it moves to a new location area. It can also periodically inform the network of the device's location.

**Example**: A SIM card has (re)authenticated with a different network element. If successful, the device will show as `Attached` in the [emnify Portal](usage#the-emnify-portal) and can already receive SMS.


### Update GPRS location
Registers or updates the device's GRPS location on the data network. The serving GPRS support node (SGSN) then uses that information to provide functionality switching, security, and authentication. 

**Example**: A SIM card has successfully registered for data sessions with a different network element.


### Purge location
Purges the device location when the device is unreachable or switched off, and the network doesn't know its location. 

**Example**: The network deletes the routing information for a mobile-terminated call or mobile-terminated short message and marks the device not reachable.

### Purge GPRS location
Purges the device's GPRS location after the device is inactive and doesn't send or receive any packets.

## Data Connection Lifecycle

| ID   | Description  |
| ---- | ------------ |
| 3    | Create PDP Context |
| 5    | Delete PDP Context |
| 49   | Device offline |

### Create PDP Context
Indicates the activation or rejection of data connectivity. 

**Example**: A device has established a data session and started transferring data. This device will show as `Online` in the [emnify Portal](usage#the-emnify-portal) (as long as there hasn't been a subsequent 'Delete PDP Context' event).


### Delete PDP Context
Deletes the data session between the device and the network. 

**Example**: A device disconnected and ended a data transfer. The event details will also show the data transmitted, and the device status will show as `Offline` in the [emnify Portal](usage#the-emnify-portal).

### Device offline
Device deletes a PDP context and doesn't create a new PDP context within 5 minutes. 

**Example**: A device is no longer attached to a network and hasn't tried to connect to a network for 24-48 hours.

### SIM activation
Patches a SIM to the "Activated" status (meaning it's able to use network services) after previously holding one of the following statuses: "Issued," "Suspended," or "Factory Test." 

Triggered through the [emnify REST API](usage#emnify-rest-api) or the [emnify Portal](usage#emnify-portal).

### SIM suspension
Patches a SIM to the "Suspended" status (meaning it's temporarily suspended and blocked from network access). 

It's possible to activate a SIM with the "Suspended" status again at any time.

### SIM deletion
Deletes a SIM, permanently removing it from the SIM repository. Once deleted, the SIM cannot be restored for network access. 

Triggered through the [emnify REST API](usage#emnify-rest-api) or the [emnify Portal](usage#emnify-portal).

### Endpoint enabled
Enables a device.

Triggered through the [emnify REST API](usage#emnify-rest-api) or the [emnify Portal](usage#emnify-portal).

### Endpoint disabled
Disables a device.

Triggered through the [emnify REST API](usage#emnify-rest-api) or the [emnify Portal](usage#emnify-portal).

### SIM issued
Patches a SIM to the "Activated" or "Suspended" status. 

**Note**: Only the emnify team can patch a SIM to the "Issued" status.

### SIM factory
Patches a SIM to the "Factory Test" status (for SIM testing).

### SIM registration
Indicates that a SIM or SIM batch is registered to an organization via a [Batch Identification Code (BIC)](https://www.emnify.com/developers/documentation#_glossary). 

**Note**: This event doesn't trigger when the emnify team assigns SIMs to an organization. It also doesn't trigger for every SIM of a SIM batch, so the event log will only be visible on the individual SIM when registering single SIM batches.

### SIM Released
Releases a SIM from a device. 

Triggered through the [emnify User Interface (EUI)](https://support.emnify.com/hc/en-us/sections/115000969189-EMnify-User-Interface-EUI-).

### SIM Assigned
Assigns a SIM to a device. 

Triggered through the [emnify User Interface (EUI)](https://support.emnify.com/hc/en-us/sections/115000969189-EMnify-User-Interface-EUI-) or while [creating an endpoint using the emnify REST API](https://cdn.emnify.net/api/doc/swagger.html#/Endpoint/CreateEndpoint).

## Limit Enforcement 

| ID   | Description  |     
| ---- | ------------ |
| 11   | Endpoint blocked |
