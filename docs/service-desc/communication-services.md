### Public Internet Breakout

### Virtual Private Network

### Inter-device communication

Traditionally, short message service center (SMSC) facilitates short message service (SMS) communications between devices on the network.
Text messaging and many Internet of Things applications depend on SMSCs to relay communications from one device to another.
In order to communicate with a network’s SMSC, you’ll need to enable your application to use Short Message Peer-to-Peer Protocol (SMPP).
This is a complex protocol that can be difficult to work with. 

At emnify, we simplify SMS communication with our RESTful API.
This enables your devices to communicate over SMS using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), and you don’t have to worry about SMPP.

### Regional Breakout

## SMS

SMS messages can play a pivotal role in remote IoT device management and automation.
Since SMS works without a data connection, it's a reliable way to communicate with remote IoT devices.

By designing devices to accept SMS parameters, most manufacturers have eased the burden of configuring a fleet of devices, both for the initial connectivity configuration as well as for post-deployment configuration changes.

By leveraging SMS for specific tasks that would overwise require power-hungry data connections, devices can operate more efficiently by conserving battery power.

With SMS in place for your remote configuration, you can also use it to trigger additional actions on a device.
For example, if you wanted to perform an update, you could use SMS to trigger a firmware OTA update.
