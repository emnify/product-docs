# Working with the emnify REST API

REST APIs are one way to integrate external services into your application.
The emnify API provides a variety of HTTP requests to integrate several emnify services into your application.

The emnify API is based on the OpenAPI Specification OAS3.
You can try out our API using the [API reference](https://cdn.emnify.net/api/doc/swagger.html).

## Code samples

See our GitHub repository for [examples of using the emnify API with JavaScript](https://github.com/emnify/API_Examples_JS).
