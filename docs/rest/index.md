# emnify REST API

REST APIs are one way to integrate external services into your application.
The emnify API provides a variety of HTTP requests to integrate several emnify services into your application.

The emnify REST API is based on the OpenAPI Specification OAS3.
You can try out the API using the [interactive API reference](https://cdn.emnify.net/api/doc/swagger.html).

## Code samples

See the [emnify examples in JavaScript](https://github.com/emnify/API_Examples_JS) GitHub repository for examples of how to authenticate and get the device status via the REST API.
