# emnify REST API

All communication management capabilities available on the emnify Portal are exposed via a REST API that you can call from your programming language of choice.
You can monitor and manage M2M connectivity, SIMs, devices, billing, invoicing, and more.
For example, you can synchronize SIM and device activation in the field and query and control networking functions from the application.
Additionally, you can also retrieve and send SMS via the REST API.

Due to the extensive API offerings, you can develop your own connectivity management platform or integrate your existing service platform.
The emnify REST API is well documented and based on the [OpenAPI Specification OAS3](https://oai.github.io/Documentation/specification.html).

Guides, examples, and reference documentation are available in the [emnify System Documentation](https://cdn.emnify.net/api/doc/index.html).
You can also try out the API using the [interactive API reference](https://cdn.emnify.net/api/doc/swagger.html).
