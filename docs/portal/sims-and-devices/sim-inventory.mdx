# SIM inventory

import Table from '@site/src/components/Table';
import simProperties from './data/simProperties';

The [**SIM Inventory**](https://portal.emnify.com/sim-inventory) provides a complete list of your registered SIMs.

## SIM states

A SIM can transition through five states during its lifecycle: **Issued**, **Activated**, **Suspended**, **Factory Test**, and **Deleted**.
These states are sometimes referred to as the SIM status.

:::info
For more information about each SIM state, see [SIM lifecycle management](/services/sim-lifecycle-management).
:::

## Manage SIMs

The **Details** view shows all identifiers and properties for an individual SIM, including:

<Table data={simProperties} />

:::tip
For definitions of any unfamiliar terms or acronyms, see the [Glossary](/glossary).
:::

### Additional views

**Events** and **Statistics** are additional views that provide logs and aggregated usage, respectively, if the SIM has been assigned to a device and is **Active**.

## Search SIMs

You can search by various attributes, including ICCID, IMSI, and device ID, to name a few.
