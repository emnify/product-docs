# SIM inventory

import Table from '@site/src/components/Table';
import simPropertiesData from './data/simProperties'

The [**SIM Inventory**](https://portal.emnify.com/sim-inventory) provides a complete list of your registered SIMs.

## SIM states

A SIM can transition through five states during its lifecycle: **Issued**, **Activated**, **Suspended**, **Factory Test**, and **Deleted**.
These states are sometimes referred to as the SIM status.

For more information about each SIM state, see [SIM lifecycle management](/services/sim-lifecycle-management).
