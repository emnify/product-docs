# Device policies

You can use [**Device Policies**](https://portal.emnify.com/device-policies) to create unique coverage and network configurations that can be assigned to devices.
There are two types of policies: **Service Policies** and **Coverage Policies**.

## Service policies

Service policies allow you to set usage limits on data or SMS and can also be used to restrict types of networks or services.
By default, a new policy has no restrictions.
However, by creating a service policy, you can control the following attributes:

| Property        | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Breakout Region | Automatic or manual selection  |
| Data            | <ul><li>Usage limit</li><li>Service type (for example, 2G, 3G, 4G, NB-IoT)</li></ul> |
| SMS             | <ul><li>SMS MO (devices may send SMS)</li><ul><li>Sending limit</li></ul><li>SMS MT (devices may receive SMS)</li><ul><li>Receiving limit</li></ul><li>Allow/deny the exchange of SMS</li><ul><li>Between devices</li><li>With external parties</li></ul></ul> |
| SMS Interface   | <ul><li>[Web Portal](/how-tos/send-sms-portal) (default)</li><li>[Webhook](/how-tos/configure-sms-interface#webhook)</li><li>[SMPP](/how-tos/configure-sms-interface#smpp)</li></ul> |

## Coverage policies

A coverage policy lets you choose which data plan and regions to operate in.
Policies include the **Data Plan** and one or more **Coverage areas**.
The default coverage policy depends on your current subscription package.

### Data plan

The **Data Plan** dropdown shows a list of data plan names with **Regional Pro** selected by default.

:::info
When a data plan includes active SIMs, it's added to your bill at the end of the month.

### Coverage areas

The list of **Coverage areas** varies depending on which **Data Plan** you selected.

The **Coverage map** is a global map that shows your coverage based on your selections.
You can browse the entire list of countries in the **Coverage list** or search for a specific country where you plan to deploy your devices.
This list provides the names and number of networks per country.
Each country's listing can be expanded to reveal the network, coverage area, data rates, and SMS sending and receiving rates.
