# Connected devices

 [**Connected Devices**](https://portal.emnify.com/connected-devices) is where you manage your devices.

## Create a new device 

As part of the SIM registration process, you can [create a new device](/quickstart/register-sims#create-a-new-device) for the newly registered SIM while still in the SIM registration dialog.

To create a new device to be used with an unattached SIM, navigate to [**Connected Devices**](https://portal.emnify.com/connected-devices) and select **Add Device**.
After providing a name for the new device and selecting device policies, you can select a SIM from the list of registered, unassigned SIMs or search for a specific SIM under **Assign SIM (optional)**.

## Get your device online

If this is your first time configuring a device for network connectivity, see the [instructions for how to get your first device online](/apn-configuration).

## Get device information 

To view all information about a device, navigate to [**Connected Devices**](https://portal.emnify.com/connected-devices), find it in the list, and select **Details**.

### Useful terms

The following terms are particularly useful to know when looking at the **Device Details**.
Each listed term includes a link to its associated [Glossary](/glossary) entry:

- [IMSI](/glossary#imsi)
- [MSISDN](/glossary#msisdn)
- [IMEI](/glossary#imei)

## Device status

<!-- vale Google.WordList = NO -->
<!-- State names are written the same as they're shown in the Portal -->
A device has only two states, **Enabled** or **Disabled**.

You can toggle one or more devices between these states to control their data usage.
A disabled device doesn't incur any charges.
<!-- vale Google.WordList = YES -->

When you want a device to connect to a network, change its status to **Enabled**.
To do this, use the **Status** toggle from the **Connected Devices** list or the device's **Details** page.

### Bulk actions

You can also perform a bulk Enable/Disable operation on a group of devices.

Use a filter to display a list of the targeted devices.
Once their checkboxes indicate that they have been selected, the bulk actions menu bar appears at the top of the screen.
Select **Device** and then one of the actions:

<!-- vale Google.OptionalPlurals = NO -->
<!-- Action names are written the same as they're shown in the Portal -->
- Enable Device(s)
- Disable Device(s)
<!-- vale Google.OptionalPlurals = YES -->
