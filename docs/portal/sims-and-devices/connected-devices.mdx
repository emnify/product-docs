# Connected devices

import Check from '../assets/check.svg';
import Close from '../assets/close.svg';
import EditFilterInstructionsPartial from '../partials/_edit-filter-instructions.mdx'

[**Connected Devices**](https://portal.emnify.com/connected-devices) is where you manage your devices.

## Create a new device

As part of the SIM registration process, you can [create a new device](/quickstart/register-sims#create-a-new-device) for the newly registered SIM while still in the SIM registration dialog.

To create a new device to be used with an unattached SIM, navigate to **Connected Devices** and select **Add Device**.
After providing a name for the new device and selecting device policies, you can select a SIM from the list of registered, unassigned SIMs or search for a specific SIM under **Assign SIM (optional)**.

## Get your device online

For information about configuring a device for network connectivity, see [Get a device online](/apn-configuration).

## Filter devices

Filters are available for both the **Extensive** and **Plain** view of the **Connected Devices** table.
These filters allow you to query devices based on one or more properties (for example, assigned tags or the device ID).

<EditFilterInstructionsPartial tableValueType="devices" />

:::warning
Your selected filters remain active when you visit a device's **Details** page.
However, the filters reset if you go to another page in the Portal.
:::

### Available filters

| Property        | Value      | [Wildcard support](#wildcard-support) | Description        |
|:----------------|:-----------|:--------------------------------------:|:-------------------|
| Name            | String     | <Check alt="Yes" />         | Name of a device. |
| ICCID           | String     | <Check alt="Yes" />         | Integrated circuit card identifier including the final Luhn checksum digit. |
| Tag             | String     | <Check alt="Yes" />         | Name of a tag you've assigned to a device.  |
| Device ID       | String     | <Close alt="No" />       | Unique identifier for a device.  |
| Status          | Predefined | <Close alt="No" />        | List of possible device statuses, specifically: **Enabled** or **Disabled**.  |
| EID             | String     | <Check alt="Yes" />         | Unique global serial number for an eUICC.  |
| IMEI            | String     | <Check alt="Yes" />         | International mobile equipment identity, used to identify cellular modems.  |
| IP address      | String     | <Check alt="Yes" />         | Unique address that identifies a device on the internet or a local network (for example, `10.1.1.9`).   |
| Coverage policy | Predefined | <Close alt="No" />        | List of your configured [coverage policies](/portal/device-policies#coverage-policies).  |
| Service policy  | Predefined | <Close alt="No" />        | List of your configured [service policies](/portal/device-policies#service-policies).   |

### Wildcard support

<WildcardSupportPartial />

For example, if you have two devices named `Phase modem` and `My iPhone`, filtering for `ph` or `ph*e` shows both devices in the results.
Another example is filtering names using `organi*ation` shows all results regardless of whether the device name uses American (organization) or British (organisation) spelling.

### Upload a CSV file

<UploadCsvFilePartial
  tableName="Connected Devices"
  example="ICCID"
  tableValueType="devices"
/>

### Enter a list of values

<EnterValuesListPartial example="Tag" />

```txt
test
v1
beta
```

Each value is parsed, and the table shows any devices with the `test`, `v1`, and `beta` tags.

## Search devices

The **Connected Devices** search bar is next to the **Add device** button.
It's visible on both the **Extensive** and **Plain** table view.

To search your devices, type a value in the text field, then press the `Enter` key.
To reset, click the corresponding **X**.

  alt=""
/>

:::info
All the [Available filter properties](#available-filters) are searchable except **Status**, **Coverage policy**, and **Service policy**.
:::

Unlike filters, where the results are focused on one property, the search simultaneously looks for matches across multiple properties.
For example, if you enter the number `2`, the search results would show any device with `2` in its name (like `WalkieTalkie 2.0`), any assigned tags, or one or more of its numeric values (**ICCID**, **EID**, etc.).

The search is case insensitive, meaning `GPS Tracker` and `gps tracker` would produce the same results.
You can also combine the search with filters, but searched values aren't saved in the URL.

:::warning
Wildcards using an asterisk `*` aren't supported in the search bar.

For example, if your device's **Name** is `My iPhone`, searching `phone` would show results, but searching `*phone` wouldn't.
:::

## Get device information

To view all information about a device, navigate to **Connected Devices**, find it in the list, and select **Details**.

The **General** view shows the following properties:

| Property          | Description                                      |
|:------------------|:-------------------------------------------------|
| Status            | Current state of the device (in this document, see [Device status](#device-status)). |
| Services          | Indicates whether the following services are active or disabled: <ul><li>Data</li><li>SMS MT</li><li>SMS MO</li></ul> |
| Connection        | [Connectivity status](/glossary#connectivity-status) and available PDP context, with an option to reset the connectivity. <br /><br /> If the device is **Online**, click the `i` icon to show all connectivity information—breakout IP, MSC, VLR, etc. |
| Blocked networks | Names of any operators on the device's networks blocklist (often used for [troubleshooting](/quickstart/troubleshooting#other-general-troubleshooting-tips)). |
| Device            | Identifiers for the device, including: <ul><li>Device ID (referred to as `endpoint_id` when working with the [REST API](https://cdn.emnify.net/api/doc/endpoint.html))</li><li>Configured IP address</li><li>IMEI and a toggle to indicate whether [IMEI lock](/services/security#imei-lock) is turned on</li></ul> |
| Policies          | Names of the assigned [service policy](/portal/device-policies#service-policies) and [coverage policy](/portal/device-policies#coverage-policies). |
| SIM               | Properties of the assigned SIM, including: <ul><li>IMSI</li><li>MSISDN</li><li>ICCID</li></ul> Also includes an option to release the SIM. If there's no assigned SIM, this section is empty and shows an option to assign a SIM. |
| Usage             | Data and SMS traffic based on a selected time period: <ul><li>Last hour</li><li>Current month</li><li>Last month</li></ul> |

:::tip

## Device status

| State            | Description                                      |
|:-----------------|:-------------------------------------------------|
| **Enabled**       | A SIM is assigned to the device and activated. The device must be enabled to connect to a network. |
| **Disabled**    | No SIM assigned, or the assigned SIM is suspended. |
| **Deleted**    | Permanently removed from your **Connected Devices**. |

### Configure the device status

A device has only two configurable states, **Enabled** or **Disabled**.
You can toggle one or more devices between these states to control their data usage.

:::warning
If you're using the [emnify REST API](https://cdn.emnify.net/api/doc/index.html) to configure devices, it's possible to have a **Disabled** endpoint with an **Activated** assigned SIM.
In this case, you'll continue to accrue costs as emnify charges for activated SIMs.
Be sure to suspend the assigned SIM to avoid unexpected charges.

You can also check the **Dashboard** to see if you have unused but charged SIMs.
<img
  src={require('./assets/portal-dashboard-unused-sim-warning.png').default}
  alt="Warning banner displayed for unused SIMs displayed on the emnify Portal Dashboard. It reads, '2 unused but charged SIM cards detected. We found active SIMs not connected to any device. In this case we may still charge for them, but they won't be of any use for you.' Next to this text, there's a link to the SIM Inventory and a button reading 'Deactivate SIMs now.'"
/>

Reference: [Endpoint Object](https://cdn.emnify.net/api/doc/endpoint.html) and [Endpoint API](https://cdn.emnify.net/api/doc/swagger.html#/Endpoint)
:::

When you want a device to connect to a network, change its status to **Enabled**.
To do this, use the **Status** toggle from the **Connected Devices** list or the device's **Details** page.

### Bulk actions

You can also perform a bulk Enable/Disable operation on a group of devices.

Use a filter to display a list of the targeted devices.
Once their checkboxes indicate that they have been selected, the bulk actions menu bar appears at the top of the screen.
Select **Device** and then one of the actions:

<!-- vale Google.OptionalPlurals = NO -->
- Enable Device(s)
- Disable Device(s)
<!-- vale Google.OptionalPlurals = YES -->

</details>

:::warning
Devices can't be deleted.
You can rename or repurpose unwanted devices for use with unassigned SIMs.
:::

## Reset connectivity

You can reset a device's connectivity by selecting its **Reset connectivity** icon while viewing it in the list of **Connected Devices** or by selecting the **Reset Connectivity** link for **Connection** located in the **Status** column of the **General** view of the device's **Details** modal.
