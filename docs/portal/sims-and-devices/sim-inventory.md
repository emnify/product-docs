# SIM inventory

## SIM states

A SIM can transition through five states during its lifecycle, **Issued**, **Activated**, **Suspended**, **Factory Test**, and **Deleted**.

These states are sometimes referred to as the [SIM status](/glossary#sim-status).

## SIM management

The [**SIM Inventory**](https://portal.emnify.com/sim-inventory) page provides a complete list of your registered SIMs.
You can search by various identifiers, including [ICCID](/glossary#iccid), [EID](/glossary#eid), and phone number, to name a few.

The **Details** view of a SIM shows all identifiers as well as:

- **Assigned device** (if the SIM is attached to a device)
- **Vendor**
- **Memory** 
- **Produced** (date and time)
- **Model**
- **SIM Type** (for example, triple-cut commercial)

**Events** and **Statistics** are additional views that provide logs and aggregated usage, respectively, if the SIM has been assigned to a device and is **Active**.

To expand your SIM inventory, follow the appropriate link at the top of the page:

- To visit the [SIM Shop](https://portal.emnify.com/sim-order), select **Order SIMs**
- To [register SIMs](https://portal.emnify.com/sim-registration), either individually or in batches, select **Register SIMs**.
