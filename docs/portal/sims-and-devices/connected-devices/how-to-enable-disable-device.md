# How to evable/disable device

Use a filter to display a list of the targeted devices.
Once their checkboxes indicate that they have been selected, the bulk actions menu bar appears at the top of the screen.

Select **Device** and then one of the actions:

<!-- vale Google.OptionalPlurals = NO -->
<!-- Action names are written the same as they're shown in the Portal -->
- Enable Device(s)
- Disable Device(s)
<!-- vale Google.OptionalPlurals = YES -->

The following image shows, where this is done in the Portal.
