To search your devices, type a value in the text field, then press the `Enter` key.
To reset, click the corresponding **X**.

:::caution
Wildcards using an asterisk `*` aren't supported in the search bar.

For example, if your device's **Name** is `My iPhone`, searching `phone` would show results, but searching `*phone` wouldn't.
