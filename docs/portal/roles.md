# Roles and permissions

import Check from './assets/check.svg';
import Close from './assets/close.svg';

The [emnify Portal](https://portal.emnify.com/) is a powerful application to control the connectivity of devices of a production system.

Employees across your organization may use the Portal, from operations and finance to development and product.
That's why emnify offers three levels of access (referred to as **Roles**) to use and manage Portal features:

- **Administrator** (has access to all services and user management)
- **Observer** (has access to limited services)
- **User** (has access to all services)

To view and edit these roles, go to **Organization settings**&nbsp;<span aria-label="and then">></span> [**Employees**](https://portal.emnify.com/organisation-settings/users).

The following tables describe the permissions for different roles.
