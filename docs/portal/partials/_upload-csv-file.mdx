You can use a comma-separated values (CSV) file to apply multiple values to any filter that accepts string values.

This feature is especially useful if you have dozens of values (for example, 100 {props.example}s).
Importing values through a CSV file lets you skip the tedious task of entering each value individually.

To upload a CSV file, follow these steps:

1. On **{props.tableName}**, choose the corresponding filter for the property in your CSV file (for example, **{props.example}**).
1. Click **Import a CSV file**.
1. Drag and drop the file or select **Browse file** to find the file you want to import.
1. Verify the file name and line count are correct, then click **Confirm**.

Each value is parsed, and the table shows any {props.tableValueType} with the corresponding values.

:::note
Uploading a CSV file won't overwrite any existing filters.
To add or remove any values, select the filter again.
:::

Please note the following limits:

- You can only upload one `.csv` or `.txt` file at a time
- Maximum rows: 10,000
- Maximum row length: 100 characters
- The CSV file size can't exceed 400 KB in total

:::tip
You can download and view a sample CSV file to use as a template.
Choose the filter, select **Import a CSV file**, then click **Download example of right format CSV**.
