# User settings

The [**User Settings**](https://portal.emnify.com/user-settings) page is where you can manage your profile and preferences.
It's readily accessible from any page in the [emnify Portal](https://portal.emnify.com/) by selecting your initials to the right of the organization settings icon.

## User profile

You can create a profile picture, edit your name, or select your organization's name to be taken to the [**Organization Details**](https://portal.emnify.com/organisation-settings/details) form.

The **Language** dropdown lets you switch the emnify Portal to one of the following languages:

- Deutsch
- Español
- Français
- Italiano
- Português - PT
- Português - BR

## Authorization

In the **Authorization** section, there's your email address with a **Change Password** link.
However, you can't change the email address used to log in to the emnify Portal.

## Two-factor authentication

You can select **Enable** in this section to enable [two-factor authentication (2FA)](/services/security#two-factor-authentication) for your account.
If you have set up 2FA, it displays as **MFA - Activated** for your account under [**Organization Employees**](https://portal.emnify.com/organisation-settings/users).
