## User profile

You can create a profile picture, edit your name, or select your organization's name to be taken to the [**Organization Details**](https://portal.emnify.com/organisation-settings/details) form.

The **Language** dropdown lets you switch the emnify Portal to one of the following languages:

## Authorization

In the **Authorization** section, you will find your email address with a **Change Password** link.
However, you cannot change the email address used to log in to the emnify Portal.

## Two-factor authentication

You can select **Enable** in this section to enable [two-factor authentication (2FA)](/services/security#two-factor-authentication) for your account.
