# User settings

[**User Settings**](https://portal.emnify.com/user-settings) is where you can manage your profile and preferences.
It's readily accessible from any page in the emnify Portal by selecting your initials to the right of the **Workspace settings** icon.

## User profile

You can create a profile picture, edit your name, or select your organization's name to be taken to the [**Organization Details**](https://portal.emnify.com/organisation-settings/details) form.

The **Language** dropdown lets you switch the emnify Portal to one of the following languages:

- Deutsch
- Español
- Français
- Italiano
- Português - PT
- Português - BR

## Authorization

In the **Authorization** section, there's your email address with a **Change Password** link.
However, you can't change the email address used to log in to the emnify Portal.

## Two-factor authentication

You can select **Enable** in this section to set up your account's multi-factor authentication (MFA).
Once you've enabled MFA, your **Account security** shows **Active** in the [**Users**](https://portal.emnify.com/organisation-settings/users) table, and you can [manage trusted devices](/how-tos/multi-factor-authentication#manage-trusted-devices).

:::warning[important update]
MFA will be mandatory for all emnify Portal accounts as of January 2024 to proactively safeguard emnify's IoT ecosystem and meet regulatory security compliance.
For more information and configuration instructions, see [Set up multi-factor authentication](/how-tos/multi-factor-authentication).
