## Find employees

The **Filter by** dropdown offers three options:

| Option           | Description                                             |
|:-----------------|:--------------------------------------------------------|
| **User ID**      | A single number that must match exactly.                |
| **Name**         | Matches can be partial. This is the only filter that can return multiple results.  |
| **Email**        | Only an exact match returns the employee's account. |

## Update an employee's account

The only employee account attributes that an **Administrator** can change are:

- **Name**: You can edit an employee's name directly in the **Organization Employees** list.
- **Status**: You can suspend an active account or activate a suspended account.
