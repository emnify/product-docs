# Subscription

The **Subscription** page lets you view your current package's details or learn about the other packages.

## Current package details

If your package is active, you see the following information:

- **Package** (Starter, Plus, or Pro)
- **Price**
- **Billing type** (for example, Monthly billing)
- **Additional features**

## Choose a package

Go to [**Subscription**](https://portal.emnify.com/organisation-settings/subscription) to compare the differences in features, services, and pricing between the packages:

- Starter (Select **Upgrade**)
- Plus (Select **Contact Us**)
- Pro (Select **Contact Us**)

## Pricing

If you select **Upgrade**, you'll be taken to the **Pricing** page.
To finalize your payment plan, you need to provide some estimates regarding your deployment plans, the geographical coverage you need, and which price model you prefer.

### Deployment

In this section, your estimates of how many devices you plan to deploy and their average monthly data usage are used to assess the resource requirements of your deployment.

#### Active device

Select the **number of active devices** you plan to have.
The slider provides a range from 1 to 1,000,000 devices.

:::note
If you want to specify an exact number of devices that the slider isn't providing, you can select the current number in the input field next to **Active device** and type in the desired value.
:::

#### Average data usage per month

Select a value between 0.25 MB and 2 GB using the slider.

#### Deployment option

If the default selection **Global** isn't your preference, select _one_ from more than a dozen other regions, for example, **Africa Extended**, **Americas**, **APAC**, **Europe Basic**, **Middle East**, **USA**, etc.

### Coverage

Choose between **Basic** and **Extended** coverage.

### Price model

Choose between **Pay-per-Use** and **Pooled allowance (with shared data)**.

## Coverage map

The **Coverage map** is a global map that shows the coverage you have based on your selections.

## Coverage list

The **Coverage list** provides the names and number of networks per country.
Each country's listing can be expanded to reveal the network, coverage area, data rates, and SMS sending and receiving rates.
You can search the list by country name or select **By Coverage Area** to see which countries and their respective networks belong to each coverage area.

## Finalize your package selection

After you have reviewed your package selections, select **Get started**.
You'll then be directed to the **Data plan upgrade** page.

## Data plan upgrade

On the **Data plan upgrade** page, you'll have an opportunity to confirm the following:

1. [**Organization details**](https://portal.emnify.com/organisation-settings/details)
1. [**Contact information**](/portal/org/data#contact-information)
1. **Payment details** (choose an option)
    - Card
    - PayPal

When finished, select **Save**.

:::caution
Your new package is charged immediately in the next billing cycle.
You'll be charged the total package price regardless of when you upgrade, as emnify doesn't prorate.

## Cancel your package

You can cancel your package monthly, unless your contract specifies otherwise.
To cancel your current package, contact the [emnify support team](/support).
