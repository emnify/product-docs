# Workspaces

This feature comes with the **Pro Package**.
It's designed to address the needs of organizations with complex business structures and those with diverse product lines.

## Useful terms

The following terms are commonly used when discussing the Workspaces feature.
Each listed term includes a link to its associated glossary entry:

- [Workspaces](/glossary#workspace)
- [Linked workspaces](/glossary#linked-workspaces)
- [Main organization](/glossary#main-organization)
- [Workspace switcher](/glossary#workspace-switcher)

## Features

Implementing **Workspaces** reduces operational costs and management complexity for organizations that meet the specified criteria.
Administrators with privileges to manage linked workspaces only need one set of login credentials to administer them all.

There are other benefits and solutions that **Workspaces** can provide, but these vary depending on the organization, such as:

### Partition of business units

This helps facilitate requirements for supporting fundamental differences in the following:

- IoT businesses
- Services or product lines
- Billing conditions
- Currencies
- Tax requirements

### Partition access and visibility

- Workspace users see only the IoT assets they need to manage.
- Administrators manage only the users in their business unit.
