# Dashboard

The [**Dashboard**](https://portal.emnify.com/) is the first page you'll see after logging in to the emnify Portal.
It shows you a summary of your usage for the current billing cycle, as well as recent events.

## Usage summary 

**Current Month Data Volume**
  - Uploaded volume
  - Downloaded volume

**Inclusive Volume (per active device)**  
This is the free data volume based on (the [Main zone](/portal/device-policies#zones)) you chose for your [Coverage Policy](/portal/device-policies#coverage-policies).

For instance, if you selected **Europe Basic** as your *Main zone*, your first 100 MB (pooled across multiple devices) are free.
If the rate for this zone is €0.10 per MB, then you will see **100 MB in Europe Basic € 1.00** here.

**Current Data/SMS Cost**  
The running balance of total costs in your currency.

**Active (charged) devices** (count)
  - **SMS** (current usage costs in your currency)
  - **SMS fee** (in your currency))

**Device Traffic**  
A chart showing the last 4 hours of upload/download volumes.

**Devices Status**
  - **Online** (count)
  - **Disabled** (count)
  - **Offline** (count)
