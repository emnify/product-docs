We provide you with a choice of different plans, a globally based customer success team, and support with global roaming to ensure that you have connectivity wherever you need it.

## Support plans

emnify offers a variety of support plans designed to ensure that your devices operate reliably in our network.
The **Standard** support plan is included for all customers at no additional cost.
It's the default service plan when registering through our website using the [emnify Portal](https://portal.emnify.com/).
For a detailed description of the standard services, please refer to our [Terms of Service](https://www.emnify.com/hubfs/20211001_terms_of_service_and_standard_service_level_obligations.pdf).

The **Business** and **Enterprise** plans offer premium customer service and can be bundled with your emnify subscription.

## Incident management

emnify's network operation center (NOC) monitors the health of all cellular networks and services that emnify offers 24x7.
The NOC proactively identifies any degradation of service.
In case of an incident, it starts the incident management process that alerts a team of on-call  engineers to start an investigation.  

When an incident is triggered due to network-related events, the responding team diagnoses the fault and escalate the incident to emnify’s carrier and roaming partners if necessary.
Optionally, any network causing a service disruption is blocked so that devices can connect to alternate networks.  

During an incident, emnify updates the [Status](https://status.emnify.com/) page for all services in order keep customers informed in real time about the status of the incident and its impact.

For critical and operational incidents, emnify conducts a root cause analysis (RCA) and issues a postmortem that provides details about the incident, which changes have been applied, and which measures are planned to guard against future incidents.  

The incident management process is reviewed annually and certified by a third party as part of emnify’s SOC2 audit.

### Critical incidents

A _critical_ incident is defined as a complete breakdown, total outage/interruption, or critical degradation of emnify's service that renders it unavailable.
For example:

- An outage/interruption or critical degradation of emnify's services
- Data service degradation affecting a minimum of 1,000 devices
- Critical degradation of the VPN
- emnify Portal unavailability
- emnify REST API unavailability

### Operational incidents

An _operational_ incident is characterized by emnify's service having partial functionality.
Performance is degraded or limited, but regular services are still available.
Immediate attention might be required if quality levels can't be fully achieved.
For example:

- Data service degradation affecting a minimum of 25 connected devices
- SMS total outage or interruption affecting a minimum of 25 connected devices
- VPN service degradation affecting a minimum of 25 devices
- Requesting BIC2 codes or invalid BIC code related issues 
- Unavailability of Regional Internet Breakouts
- Data Streamer interruption or delay of five minutes

## Customer success managers

In addition to emnify’s 24x7 support and network operation center (NOC), each customer has access to a Customer Success Manager (CSM).
CSMs comprise a globally distributed team with local working hours.
They're fluent in emnify's main supported languages: English, Spanish, Italian, French, and German.
The CSM team proactively engages with their customers to help them obtain value from the product and guide them through their journey.
They also conduct onboarding sessions to get their customers acquainted with the platform and help with setting up integrations.

## Roaming

Unlike typical mobile network operators ([MNO](https://www.emnify.com/iot-glossary/mno)s), emnify also provides 24/7 support when your device is in roaming scenarios.
The emnify network operation center (NOC) has visibility of all networks in the world and can detect network service degradation.
emnify also investigates and follows up even when only your fleet of devices is affected.

Based on the direct and IoT/M2M specific roaming relationships with network operators, emnify has service-level agreements (SLAs) to resolve critical and operational incidents within specific timelines.  
So you'll never need to worry about roaming when your IoT devices are moved to another location, even if it's to another country or continent.

Support for the global deployment of IoT devices is a key feature of emnify's [Global IoT Network](/services/global-iot-network).
