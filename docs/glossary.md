# Glossary

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD036 -->

## APN

_Access Point Name_

A gateway between a [GSM](#gsm), GPRS, 3G, or 4G mobile network and another computer network, usually the public Internet.
The APN needs to be configured on the device. For emnify, it's `em` or `emnify`.

## Application token

A unique identification key used to authenticate emnify's APIs.
Also used when authenticating the [OpenVPN](#openvpn) service.

## A2P SMS

_Application-to-Peer SMS_

The SMS sent and received between an application and a device (or vice versa).

:::

## Assigned SIM

SIM that has been assigned to a device.

## AT+CREG AT command

Gives information about the registration status and access technology of the serving cell.

## AuC

_Authentication Center_

A part of [GSM](#gsm) infrastructure, validates any SIM card attempting network connection when a phone has a live network signal.

## BIC

_Batch Identification Code_

A unique code for ordered SIM cards used to register the SIM cards in the [**SIM Inventory**](https://portal.emnify.com/sim-inventory).

## Callback URL

URL that will be called by a service to send and receive data related to an event that caused this action.

## Carrier-agnostic network

A network that doesn't limit or prefer any specific network in a country and establishes a connection over any network that's transparent to the device.

## Check digit

A checksum appended to identification data (for example, [IMEI](#imei), [EID](#eid), or [ICCID](#iccid)) representing the preceding digits and calculated using an algorithm.

Check digits are used to validate the identifier, verify data integrity, and help prevent errors in equipment databases.

:::tip
Several identifiers have a check digits but can be calculated differently and have different names.
For example, [ICCID](#iccid) numbers use a [_Luhn checksum digit_](#luhn-checksum-digit), while the last digits of the [EID](#eid) are called _check digits_.
:::

## Connectivity status

This is the connectivity status of a device.
It can be set to:

- **Online**: Device is transmitting or can transmit data through a data tunnel.
- **Attached**: Device is attached to a network but hasn't established a data tunnel.
- **Offline**: Device isn’t attached to a network.
- **Blocked**

## Coverage policy

_Referred to as [**Tariff Profile**](https://cdn.emnify.net/api/doc/tariff-profile.html) in the API_

A policy that defines which networks or countries SIM should operate in.

## CSM

_Customer success manager_

A member of emnify’s team dedicated to helping you grow and achieve your goals.
For a full explanation of the role, see [Support](/support).

## Data RX

## Default Workspace

The [Workspace](#workspace) you log into when you visit the [emnify Portal](https://portal.emnify.com/).
This value is independent and defined on a per-user basis.

:::note
You can't log in directly to a Workspace that isn't your default.
For most people, the first Workspace you were invited to is your default.

Instead of using a periodicity of 2.56 ms (DRX) it can be increased up to 40 minutes, thus reducing power consumption.

## EID

_eUICC Identifier_

The eUICC Identifier (EID) provides a unique global serial number for an [eUICC](#euicc).
It has a fixed length of 32 digits, as indicated in the following diagram:

![A 32-digit EID number: "89049011803455664400046832584675" The first 18 digits are the EUM Identification Number (EIN). Within those 18 digits, the first two digits are the Major Industry Identifier (Telecom in this example). The next three digits are the Country Code (GER in this example). The next three digits are the eUICC Manufacturer. The final 10 digits of the EIN contain information about the chip, OS, and its version. After the EIN, the following 11 digits are the EUM Specific Identification Number (ESIN). This value is also the eUICC Individual Identification Number. The final two digits of the EID are the Check Digits.](assets/infographic-eid-digits.png)

:::note
The EUM specific identification number (ESIN) and [check digits](#check-digit) are for example purposes only, and the values aren't real.
:::

Unlike the [ICCID](#iccid), the EID remains the same throughout the life of the eSIM.
Therefore, you can use it as a permanent identifier to keep track of your SIM cards.

## Endpoint

A representation of the device which has a SIM installed.
Often used as a legacy term for a **device**, particularly in the [REST API](https://cdn.emnify.net/api/doc/endpoint.html).

## eSIM

_Embedded SIM_

Because of the "e" (for _embedded_) in its name, _eSIM_ is sometimes incorrectly used for referring to the MFF2 physical form factor of an [eUICC](#euicc) chip that's designed to be permanently surface-mounted inside a device.
Within the IoT industry, _eSIM_ refers to the entire solution that's comprised of an eUICC-equipped [SIM](#sim) along with the software platform for [OTA provisioning](#ota-provisioning).
Although eSIMs can be embedded directly in a device, they're also manufactured as pluggable SIM cards.
The [emnify eSIM](/services/global-iot-sim) has capabilities not available with other eSIMs.

## eUICC

_Embedded Universal Integrated Circuit Card_

The embedded universal integrated circuit card (eUICC) is a component of a [SIM](#sim) card.
It allows consumers and IoT manufacturers to provision the SIM with a new [mobile network operator (MNO)](https://www.emnify.com/iot-glossary/mno) profile [over-the-air](#ota).

:::tip
Learn more about the eUICC in the blog post: [What is an eUICC and why does it matter?](https://www.emnify.com/iot-glossary/what-is-an-euicc)
:::

## Event log

- **2FF**: Mini SIM card
- **3FF**: Micro SIM card
- **4FF**: Nano SIM card

## IC

_Integrated Circuit_

A semiconductor chip containing a large number of extremely small electronic components.
For example, a CPU, the chips on computer memory cards, the electronic part of a [SIM](#sim) card, an [eUICC](#euicc), etc.

## ICCID

_Integrated Circuit Card Identifier_

The integrated circuit card identifier (ICCID) is a 20-digit code used to identify a SIM card.
It includes a SIM card's country, home network, and identification number, as indicated in the following diagram:

![A 20-digit ICCID number: "89883030000080139311" The first two digits are the Major Industry Identifier (Telecom in this example). The next three digits are the Country Code (non-terrestrial). The following two digits are the Issuer Identifier (emnify). After that, the next 11 digits are the Individual Account Identification. The final digit is the Check Digit.](assets/infographic-iccid-digits.png)

:::info
Following the introduction of [eUICC](#euicc) SIM cards in 2021, there are situations where the ICCID can no longer be unique.
For example, the ICCID value can change when a different [SIM profile](#sim-profile) is provisioned on the eSIM.
:::

:::note
The emnify REST API returns two ICCID values: `iccid` and `iccid_with_luhn`.
The `iccid_with_luhn` value _includes_ the final [Luhn checksum digit](#luhn-checksum-digit), while the `iccid` value doesn't.

## IMSI

_International Mobile Subscriber Identity_

A unique number used to identify a [GSM](#gsm) subscriber.

<details className="custom-details-example">
  <summary>See how the IMSI is constructed</summary>
  An IMSI is usually a 15-digit number but can be 14 digits in some cases.

  It comprises three components: MCC, MNC, and MSIN.

  MCC: 3-digit country identifier
  MNC: operator identifier (two or three digits)
  MSIN: identifier for the connected device (nine or 10 digits)
