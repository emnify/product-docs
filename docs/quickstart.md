# Quickstart

To begin developing your IoT solutions with emnify, you will need an emnify account.
[Sign up](https://portal.emnify.com/sign/up?utm_source=dev-hub) for free to a 60-day trial to use all functionalities.

## Order a free evaluation SIM package

You can order your free Evaluation SIM package on the emnify Portal with which you can test all emnify services.
Currently, the 3 physical SIM cards can be delivered to many destinations at no charge.
For other destinations, we do charge a small shipping fee.

To get started immediately, you can download the eSIM for your smartphone or eSIM enabled tablet for free.

Log into your [emnify account](https://portal.emnify.com) and follow these steps:

1. On the dashboard, click on order on **Get your FREE SIMs**
![Order SIMs](./assets/order-SIM_step1.png)
**Order SIMSs**
2. Select the SIM cards of your choice.
![Select SIM type](assets/order-SIM_step2.png)
If you select physical SIM cards, you can further choose between 3in1 (no nano SIM) or 4in1 (with nano SIM).
![Select SIM form](assets/order-SIM_step2.1.png)
If you select the eSIM, you can directly download it into your eSIM compatible phone.
You can find the instructions to do so in this [blog post](https://www.emnify.com/en/developer-hub/emnify-developer-esim).
3. For the physical SIM cards, proceed to fill in your shipping details.
![Shipping details](assets/order-SIM_step3.png)
4. Proceed to pay the shipping charges and you will be notified when the SIM cards will be shipped.
![Payment details](assets/order-SIM_step4.png)

## Registering SIMs

Once you get your emnify SIMs, you need to register them before you can start using them.

1. If you have ordered the 3 orange evaluation SIM cards, you will have to register them one by one.
Scan the QR code printed on the SIM card with your QR code scanner app and follow the link to associate the SIM with your account.
The link includes the **BIC** (Batch Identification Code) of the card.
![Scan QR Code](assets/QRScan.png)
2. If you do not have a QR reader or want to do this on a desktop PC without a camera, register by manually entering the BIC.
Login to your [emnify account](https://portal.emnify.com?utm_source=dev-hub).
On the dashboard, click the [REGISTER](https://portal.emnify.com/sim-registration/single) link in the "Register your SIM cards" section.
![Register SIM](assets/register_sims.png)
![Register single SIM](assets/register_single_sim.png)
3. Enter the Batch Identification Code (**BIC** 1) in the prompt. You can find the BIC1 on the back of your SIM card.
![BIC1](assets/BIC.png)
4. If you have ordered more than 5 SIM cards, you need to batch register them using the **BIC2**.
![BIC2](assets/register_batch_sim.png)
![Registration complete](assets/register_sim_complete.png)

If you have a developer eSIM, the downloading process of an eSIM
automatically registers it in our portal.

## Creating a Device

After you register a SIM, you need to create a virtual representation of the device associated with the SIM.
To create a device, give it a name and assign a service and coverage policy.
![Create new device](assets/create_device.png)

If you plan on using your device right away, activate it. If you do not plan on using the device right away, select "leave disabled".

## Getting the first device online

Any device equipped with a SIM card requires an APN (Access Point Name) configuration to establish a data session.
Some devices and networks auto-detect the APN but for most cases you need to configure it.

[APN](#APN): `em` (or alternatively use `emnify`)

Further, some Android / iOS-based devices and cellular modules also need to be configured to allow for roaming.

Select your device type and model below, to see how to configure the
APN.

| [Android](#android) | [iOS devices](#ios-devices) | 
| [Cellular modules](#cellular-modules) | [GPS tracker](#gps-tracker) | [Industrial Routers](#industrial-routers) |

### Cellular modules

#### Quectel cellular IoT modules

*Applies to all Quectel modules: BG95, BG96, EG25, EG91, EG95, EC21,
EC25, M65, M66, M95, MC60, BG77, BG600L*

With Quectel modules the APN can be set with the 3GPP standard command `AT+CGDCONT`

`AT+CGDCONT=1,"IP","em",,`

Quectel also utilizes a vendor specific Command `AT+QICSGP`

`AT+QICSGP=1,1,"em","","",1`

According to [Quectel](https://www.quectel.com/faqs/12-8-what-is-the-difference-between-cgdcont-and-qicsgp/) the command `AT+QICSGP` should be used when the internal TCP/UDP stack is used.
It also lets you configure which bearer (CSD or
GPRS) is used.
GPRS must be used.

For managing roaming, Quectel also introduced the `AT+QCFG` command.
The suggested setting is:

`AT+QCFG="roamservice",2,1`

:::note
Check your Quectel module AT command guide for more information.
:::

#### u-Blox cellular IoT modules

u-Blox supports the standard 3GPP command to set APNs via `AT+CGDCONT`

`AT+CGDCONT=1,"IP","em",,`

u-Blox also supports a vendor specific command to configure the APN for the initial EPS bearer.

`AT+UCGDFLT=1,"IP","em"`

For roaming configuration u-blox modules utilize a vendor specific `AT+UDCONF` command.
This enables automatic search in case the device cannot attach to a specific network.

`AT+UDCONF=20,2`

:::note
Check your u-Blox module AT command guide for more information.
:::

#### General cellular IoT modules

*Applies to a cellular module vendors: Fibocom, Telit, Sierra Wireless, SIMcom, Cinterion, Gemalto, Thales, Sequans*

## Troubleshooting

When you experience issues while connecting your device for the first time there are several common patterns that can be identified by looking at the connected device section in the portal.
If you do not have any entry in the connected devices, go back to [Creating a Device](#creating-a-device) and assign the SIM.

The device will show different icons that indicate the status: **Offline**, **Attached**, **Online**, or **Blocked**.
If no icon is visible, assign a SIM to the device.

To troubleshoot most cases, a look at **Details** â†’ **Events** is necessary.
A typical event flow should look like this:

1. Update Location - the SIM card is (re)authenticating with a different network element.
If successful the device will show as **Attached** and can already receive SMS.
2. Update GPRS location - the SIM card has successfully registered for data sessions with a different network element.
3. Create PDP context - the device has started a data transfer.
The device will show **Online** as long is there is no delete PDP context event.
4. Delete PDP context - the device has ended a data transfer.
The event details will also show the data transmitted and the device status will be set to **Offline**.

![event\_flow.png](./assets/event_flow.png)

There can be many update locations before or in between the data session.

![offline.png](./assets/offline.png) **The device is offline**

- Click **Details** and make sure the device is enabled.
- Click **Details** â†’ **Events**.
Validate if there is any location update event created and rejected.
The reasoning should indicate the resolution to the problem.
If there is no location update event:
- Make sure the device is powered on and is searching for a network.
- Make sure the device is has reception of any supported network.

![attached.png](./assets/attached.png) **The device shows attached but does not transmit data**

- Make sure the APN is correctly set to `em` or use alternatively `emnify` since some devices do not support two-character APNs.
Guides for different devices can be found [here].(#getting-the-first-device-online)
- In case you changed policy settings, make sure the radio types (2G,3G,4G) and data access is activated
- Make sure mobile data is enabled and that international roaming is allowed.
- Click **Details** â†’ **Events**.
Validate if there is any PDP create event and rejected.
The reason and resolution is given in the event description.

The **Attached** status does not necessarily mean that the device is powered on.
If the device attaches to a network and then powers off, there is no information towards the emnify network that would allow to detect this.

![online.png](./assets/online.png) **The device shows online but does not transmit data**\*

- Make sure mobile data is enabled and that international roaming is allowed.
- Validate under **Details** â†’ **Events** if any **Warn** or **Error** is detected.
- For NB-IoT and LTE-M this behaviour can happen when the device automatically connects to a network.
Specify the desired network using the `AT+COPS` command.
Also verify that the network is on emnifyâ€™s [NB-IoTcoverage](https://www.emnify.com/nb-iot-coverage) or [LTE-M network coverage](https://www.emnify.com/lte-m-coverage) list.
- Make sure your data destination and DNS server (default emnify uses googles 8.8.8.8 DNS if your device does not specify a DNS server) is not blocked for the device.

### Other general troubleshooting tips
- After configuration changes, make sure they are correctly applied on the device (e.g., with a reboot).
- Clicking the reset connectivity icon ![](./assets/reset_connectivity.png) on **Connected Devices** can also reset the network state and allow your device to freshly reattach.
- The issue may only be present with one network or in the specific location (e.g., due to high interference for this network).
You can use the **Operator Blacklist** to block the network and force the change to a different network.
