<!-- vale Google.We = NO -->

:::warning[compatibility notes]
**The emnify GraphQL API is under active development** and is subject to change.

Feedback and suggestions are very welcome.
Please [open a ticket on Canny](https://emnify.canny.io/).
:::

[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) is a query language that enables you to define API call responses to match your use case and technical needs.

The emnify GraphQL API was initially developed internally to improve performance on the Portal.
In early 2023, we decided to release a preview version to customers.
We hope to collect feedback and continue adding features so that the capability more closely matches the [emnify REST API](https://cdn.emnify.net/api/doc/index.html).

:::note
There are no plans to deprecate the REST API.
Instead, we plan to support both APIs in parallel.

## Try it out with the GraphiQL IDE

To help you explore and experiment with the GraphQL API, we've set up an in-browser [emnify GraphiQL IDE](https://graphql-playground.emnify.net/).
Within this IDE, you can also find interactive documentation and examples.

For more information, see [Use the GraphiQL IDE](/graphql/graphiql-ide).
