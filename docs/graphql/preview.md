# emnify GraphQL API <span className="badge badge--heading">preview</span>

:::warning[compatibility notes]
**The emnify GraphQL API is under active development** and is subject to change.

Feedback and suggestions are very welcome.
Please [open a ticket on Canny](https://emnify.canny.io/).
:::

[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) is a query language that enables you to define API call responses to match your use case and technical needs.
emnify initially developed the GraphQL API to improve performance on the web portal.
In early 2023, emnify decided to release a preview version to customers.
The plan is to continue adding features so that the capability more closely matches the [emnify REST API](https://cdn.emnify.net/api/doc/index.html).

:::note
There are no plans to deprecate the REST API.
Instead, we plan to support both APIs in parallel.
:::

To help you explore and experiment, the emnify GraphQL API includes an [in-browser GraphiQL integrated development environment (IDE)](https://graphql-playground.emnify.net/).
Within this IDE, you can also find interactive documentation and examples.
