# emnify GraphQL API <span className="theme-doc-version-badge badge badge--primary">preview</span>

<!-- vale Google.We = NO -->
<!-- This page introduces the GraphQL API from the perspective of emnify -->

:::caution Compatibility Notes
**The emnify GraphQL API is under active development** and is subject to change. 

[Feedback and suggestions are very welcome](https://emnify.canny.io/)!
:::

[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) is a query language that enables you to define API call responses to match your use case and technical needs. 

The emnify GraphQL API was initially developed internally to improve performance on the [Portal](https://portal.emnify.com/).
In early 2023, emnify decided to release a preview version to customers. 
We hope to collect feedback and continue adding features so that the capability more closely matches the [REST API](/rest). 

:::info
There are no plans to deprecate the [REST API](/rest). 
Instead, we plan to support both APIs in parallel.

## Try it out with the GraphiQL IDE

To help you explore and experiment with the emnify GraphQL API, we've set up an [in-browser GraphiQL IDE](https://graphql-playground.emnify.net/). 
Within this IDE, you can also find interactive documentation and examples.

[Learn more about how to use the GraphiQL IDE](/graphql/graphiql-ide).
