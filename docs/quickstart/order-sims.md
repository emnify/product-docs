:::note
You may see the **Order Split** option depending on how many SIMs you order. 
This allows you to split orders into [batches](/glossary#sim-batch) (e.g., collections of 25, 100, or 500 SIMs).

The benefit of batches is that they can be registered all at once, whereas single SIMs can only be registered individually.
