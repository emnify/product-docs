:::note
For larger orders, you can split your order into **Batches** (for example, collections of 25, 100, or 500 SIMs).

The benefit of batches is that they can be registered all at once, whereas single SIMs can only be registered individually.
To learn more, see [Register emnify SIMs](/quickstart/register-sims).
