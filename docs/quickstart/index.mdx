## Join an emnify Workspace

A Workspace is where you manage the IoT cellular connectivity for your devices.
Every emnify customer has free access to a single Workspace, and those with the **Pro Package** can manage [multiple Workspaces](/workspaces).

When you join a Workspace, you'll create an account using your email address or confirm your account if you already have one.
You can use the same email address to join as many Workspaces as you'd like, but you may have different [user roles](/portal/roles) in each Workspace.

To join a Workspace that you've been invited to, you need to accept the invitation and set up or confirm your emnify account.
