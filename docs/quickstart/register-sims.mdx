# Register emnify SIMs

Once you get your emnify SIMs, the next step is to register them.
When you register a new SIM or [SIM batch](/glossary#sim-batch), you can automatically activate the SIM and create connected devices using the default configuration.

:::info
If you [ordered free trial SIMs](/quickstart#order-free-trial-sims), you must register each SIM separately.
:::

## Locate the BIC

### Individual SIMs

The 16-digit batch identification code (BIC) is on the card's upper right corner and marked as **BIC1**.
It's used to register single SIMs.

### SIM batches

The 16-digit BIC is located on the packaging label and marked as **BIC2**.

:::tip
For more information about locating your BIC, see [I cannot register my SIM cards](https://support.emnify.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019254640-I-cannot-register-my-SIM-cards-The-BIC-code-is-invalid-or-I-do-not-have-a-BIC-code) on the Knowledge Base.

## Register SIMs in the emnify Portal

1. [Log in to your emnify account](https://portal.emnify.com/sign).
1. Navigate to the **SIM Inventory** and click **Register SIMs**.
1. Select **Single-SIM** to register individual SIM cards or select **SIM Batch** for batches.
1. Enter the **BIC1** for individual SIMs or the **BIC2** for batches.
1. After confirming your BIC is correct, select **Register SIM Card**.

Once the SIM is registered, you can assign it to an existing device or create a new device.

:::note
Assigning your SIM to a device is a necessary step for getting your device online.
We'd recommended activating the SIM and creating a connected device during registration.

## Register SIMs with the emnify REST API

The emnify REST API is an efficient approach, especially when dealing with a large number of devices and registering SIM cards in bulk.
For step-by-step instructions, see [Register SIMs in the emnify System Documentation](https://cdn.emnify.net/api/doc/register-sims.html).

## Create a new device

You can create a new device for the newly registered SIM while still in the SIM registration process.

1. After your SIM is registered, select **Create device**.
2. In **Create a new device**, name your device and assign a service policy and coverage policy.
Optionally, add tags, indicate the IP address, or [lock the IMEI](/services/security#imei-lock).
3. Choose the device mode.
If you plan on using your device right away, select **Active**.
Otherwise, select **Disabled**.

:::info
Customers with the Plus Package or Pro Package also have the option to select **Factory Test**.
For more information, see [Factory test mode](/services/factory-test-mode).
:::

4. Review your device details, then click **Create device**.

:::warning
A monthly cost is charged for each connected device.
:::

Once created, your device should be ready to go online if it's [configured with the correct APN](/apn-configuration), data roaming is enabled, and the device status is **Enabled** or **Factory test**.
