# Create a device

After you [register a SIM](/quickstart/register-sims), you need to create a virtual representation of the device associated with the SIM.
To create a device, give it a name and assign a service and coverage policy.

If you plan on using your device right away, select **Activate**.
Otherwise, select **Leave Disabled**.

## Insert the assigned SIM

:::note
Skip this step if your device already has an embedded SIM.
:::

Before you can [get your device online](/apn-configuration), insert the SIM that's [registered and assigned](/quickstart/register-sims) to the device and turn it on.
