# iOS

When setting up an iOS device with an emnify IoT SIM, you need to follow four steps:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Mobile Data**
1. Select `emnify` under **Data Plans** (first one if regular SIM or secondary if eSIM)
1. Enable **Data Roaming** and select **Mobile Data Network**
1. Set APN to `em` - leave everything else blank
