Any device equipped with a SIM card requires an [Access Point Name (APN)](/glossary#apn) configuration to establish a data session.
Some devices and networks auto-detect the APN but for most cases you need to configure it.

APN: `em` (or alternatively use `emnify`)

Further, some Android or iOS-based devices and cellular modules also need to be configured to allow for roaming.

Select your device type and model to see how to configure the APN:

- [Cellular modules](/cellular-modules-apn-configuration)
- [GPS trackers](/gps-trackers-apn-configuration)
- [Industrial routers](/industrial-routers-apn-configuration)
