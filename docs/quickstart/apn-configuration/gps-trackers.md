You have three options for configuring the APN on Teltonika GPS trackers:

- With the [Teltonika Configurator](#teltonika-configurator) over a USB or Bluetooth connection
- Through the [emnify Portal SMS console](#sms-console-teltonika) (recommended)
- Via SMS through the [emnify REST API](#rest-api-teltonika) or [Zapier Integration](https://zapier.com/apps/emnify/integrations/sms) (best option when automating the configuration)

:::note[reference]

:::

### Teltonika Configurator

Teltonika offers the Teltonika Configurator, a graphical user interface, to set device-specific parameters via USB or Bluetooth (for example, the APN and telematics server).
For usage instructions, see [Teltonika's Universal Device Test Guide](https://wiki.teltonika-gps.com/view/Universal_Device_Test_Guide).

### emnify Portal SMS console \{#sms-console-teltonika}

:::note
Newer Teltonika GPS versions automatically detect the emnify APN setting.
:::

First, turn on your device and ensure the device and emnify SIM card are activated.
If you still need to do this, follow the [Create device](/quickstart/create-device) guide.

Then, follow these steps to set up the APN:

1. Log in to your [emnify account](https://portal.emnify.com/sign).
2. Navigate to **Connected Devices** and find your Teltonika GPS tracker.
Turning on the GPS tracker for the first time after installing the SIM shows the status as **Attached**.
The device can receive SMS at this point but only establish a data session if the APN is set up or detected.
3. [Open the SMS console](/portal/sms#open-the-sms-console) and send the command corresponding to your device settings.

If you've set a username and password for the device, use the following SMS command to set the APN:

```
USERNAME PASSWORD setparam 2001:em
```

Replace _`USERNAME`_ and _`PASSWORD`_ with your credentials.

Otherwise, if there's no username or password configured, use the following:

```
  setparam 2001:em
```

:::warning
The two leading spaces are required.

### emnify REST API \{#rest-api-teltonika}

You can use the [SMS calls in the emnify REST API](https://cdn.emnify.net/api/doc/swagger.html#/Endpoint) to automate the device configuration.

To send SMS to a device, use [**POST** `/api/v1/endpoint/{endpoint_id}/sms`](https://cdn.emnify.net/api/doc/swagger.html#/Endpoint/EndpointSmsByIdPost) with the following request body:

```json
{ 
  "source_address": "123456789",
  "payload": "  setparam 2001:em" 
}
```

Replace _`123456789`_ with your chosen source address.
