First, turn on your device and ensure the device and emnify SIM card are activated.
If you still need to do this, follow the [Create device](/quickstart/create-device) guide.

Then, follow these steps to set up the APN:

1. Log in to your [emnify account](https://portal.emnify.com/sign).
2. Navigate to **Connected Devices** and find your {props.name} GPS tracker.
Turning on the GPS tracker for the first time after installing the SIM shows the status as **Attached**.
The device can receive SMS at this point but only establish a data session if the APN is set up or detected.
3. [Open the SMS console](/portal/sms#open-the-sms-console) and send the {props.alternateCommandPrompt ? props.alternateCommandPrompt : 'following command:'}
