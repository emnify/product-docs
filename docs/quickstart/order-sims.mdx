1. [Log in to your emnify account](https://portal.emnify.com/sign).
2. Navigate to the [**SIM Inventory**](https://portal.emnify.com/sim-inventory) and click **Order SIMs**.

3. Once you're in the **SIM Shop**, select your preferred SIM type.
4. Click **Step 2 - Choose Amount** to confirm your choice.

:::tip
In use cases where devices are mobile, we highly recommend choosing the form factor that fits the device exactly, not multi-cut ones that include a smaller size.
The pluggable SIMs are more durable and provide firmer contact with the device than the multi-cut.

For more information about the various form factors and quality grades, see [emnify IoT eSIM](/services/global-iot-sim).

5. You'll land on the **SIM Order** page that shows an overview of your order so far.
Here, you can specify the amount of each SIM type you want to receive.

:::note
For larger orders, you can split your order into **Batches** (for example, collections of 25, 100, or 500 SIMs).

The benefit of batches is that they can be registered all at once, whereas single SIMs can only be registered individually.
To learn more, see [Register emnify SIMs](/quickstart/register-sims).
