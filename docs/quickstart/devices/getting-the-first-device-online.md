# Getting the first device online

Any device equipped with a SIM card requires an APN (Access Point Name) configuration to establish a data session.
Some devices and networks auto-detect the APN but for most cases you need to configure it.

[APN](../../glossary#apn---access-point-name): `em` (or alternatively use `emnify`)

Further, some Android / iOS-based devices and cellular modules also need to be configured to allow for roaming.

Select your device type and model below, to see how to configure the
APN.
