# Register emnify SIMs

Once you get your emnify SIMs, the next step is to register them.
When you register a new SIM or [SIM batch](/glossary#sim-batch), you can automatically activate the SIM and create connected devices using the default configuration.

:::info
If you ordered the [free Trial SIMs](/quickstart), you must register each SIM separately.

## Locate the BIC

### Individual SIMs

The 16-digit batch identification code (BIC) is on the card's upper right corner and marked as **BIC1**.
It's used to register single SIMs.

### SIM batches

The 16-digit BIC is located on the packaging label and marked as **BIC2**.

Once the SIM is registered, you can assign it to an existing device or create a new device.

:::tip
Assigning your SIM to a device is a necessary step for getting your device online.
We'd recommended activating the SIM and creating a connected device during registration.

## Create a new device

You can create a new device for the newly registered SIM while still in the SIM registration process.

  5. Once created, your device should be ready to go online if it's [configured with the correct APN](/apn-configuration) and data roaming is enabled.
