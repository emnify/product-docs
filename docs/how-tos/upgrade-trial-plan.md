# Upgrade your Trial plan

Once you've ordered your [free Trial SIMs](/quickstart#order-free-trial-sims), your account starts with an issued prepaid credit for testing emnify's services.
After this credit is exhausted or the 60-day trial expires, you can only use emnify services if you upgrade your package.

If you are on a Trial plan with emnify and want to upgrade your account, follow these steps:

<!-- vale Google.We = NO -->
1. [Log in to your emnify account](https://portal.emnify.com/sign).
1. Click **Choose a plan** on the sidebar or navigate directly to your organization's [**Subscription**](https://portal.emnify.com/organisation-settings/subscription) page.
1. In the **Our packages** section, select the package that best fits your organization's needs, then click either **Upgrade** or **Contact Sales**.
<!-- vale Google.We = YES -->

Once your Trial plan is upgraded to a paid package, your emnify subscription begins, and you'll be automatically billed for your active SIM cards every month.
