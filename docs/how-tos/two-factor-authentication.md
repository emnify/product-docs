# Enabling two-factor authentication on your emnify account

Setting up two-factor authentication (2FA) makes unauthorized access to your account more improbable because your password is secured via your personal device, which generates a temporary authentication key.

You can enable 2FA via the emnify Portal.

## Configuration steps

1. Log in to your [emnify account](https://portal.emnify.com/sign).
2. Navigate to your [**User Settings**](https://portal.emnify.com/user-settings) page by clicking on your avatar and selecting **User Settings** from the dropdown menu.

4. Enter your password to verify your identity.

5. Activate your personal device's temporary authentication key by scanning the QR code with a 2FA app.
Alternatively, you can copy the secret key to add it manually.

After you've scanned the QR code or entered the key, a 6-digit token will appear in the app. 
Enter this token into the text field.

Assuming there are no errors, 2FA should be enabled for your account ðŸŽ‰

Now, if you log in to the emnify Portal on a device you haven't set as trusted before or use a different browser, you'll be asked to enter a one-time password to verify your identity.
