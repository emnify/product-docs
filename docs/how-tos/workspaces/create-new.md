# Create a new workspace

Every [company account](/glossary#company-account) on the [**Pro** plan](https://portal.emnify.com/organisation-settings/subscription#plans) is a [workspace](/glossary#workspace) by default.
However, there are many reasons to opt for multiple workspaces.
For example, organizations with foreign regional subsidiaries or companies producing products in multiple industries.

This guide shows you how to submit a request for a new workspace via the [emnify Portal](https://portal.emnify.com/).
Alternatively, you can also [link existing workspaces](/how-tos/workspaces/link-existing) if you already have two or more created.

:::info
Only **Admin** [user accounts](/glossary#user-account) of customers on our [**Pro** plan](https://portal.emnify.com/organisation-settings/subscription#plans) can create new workspaces.
:::

1. [Log in to your emnify account](https://portal.emnify.com/sign).
You should see your organization's name at the top of the primary sidebar.

2. Click your organization's name (or the corresponding icons) to reveal the **Workspaces** modal.
3. Select **Create a new workspace**.

<img
  src={require('./assets/portal-sidebar-workspaces-create.png').default}
  alt=""
  style={{ height:450 }}
/>

4. Once the **Request for a new workspace** modal appears, fill in your **Contact email** and provide more details or any requirements for the new workspace.
5. Click **Send Request**.

:::caution
[Organizations](/glossary#organization) can only submit one workspace request at a time.
If you need more than one workspace, include those details in the body of your request.
:::

If you see the **Request Sent** modal, your request has been submitted successfully. ðŸŽ‰

From there, our team will process your request and contact you to sort out the requirements.
Then, we'll create and set up the new workspace for you.

:::note
The process may take time, as each new workspace requires a new contract.
It usually takes 2â€“7 days for your new workspace to be ready.
