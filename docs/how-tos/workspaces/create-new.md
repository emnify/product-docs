---

# Create a new workspace

1. Log in to your [emnify account](https://portal.emnify.com/sign).
You should see your organization's name at the top of the primary sidebar.

  src={require('./assets/portal-sidebar-workspaces.png').default}
  alt=""
/>

2. Click this to reveal the **Workspaces** modal.
3. Select **Create a new workspace**.

<img
  src={require('./assets/portal-sidebar-workspaces-create.png').default}
  alt=""
  style={{ height:450 }}
/>

4. Once the **Request for a new workspace** modal appears, fill in your **Contact email** and provide more details or any requirements for the new workspace.
5. Click **Send Request**.

:::caution
Organizations can only submit one workspace request at a time.
If you need more than one workspace, include those details in the body of your request.
:::

If you see the **Request Sent** modal, your request has been submitted successfully. ðŸŽ‰

From there, our team will process your request and contact you to sort out the requirements.
Then, we'll create and set up the new workspace for you.

:::info
The process may take time, as each new workspace requires a new contract.
It usually takes 2â€“7 days for your new workspace to be ready.
