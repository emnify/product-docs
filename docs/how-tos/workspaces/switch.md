One benefit of having [linked workspaces](/glossary#linked-workspaces) is that you can manage multiple [organizations](/glossary#organization) using one emnify account.

This guide shows you how to switch between your organizations via the [workspace switcher](/glossary#workspace-switcher) in the [emnify Portal](https://portal.emnify.com/).

:::info
Only **Administrator** [user accounts](/glossary#user-account) of the [main organization](/glossary#main-organization) can switch between workspaces.
:::

1. [Log in to your emnify account](https://portal.emnify.com/sign).
You should see your organization's name at the top of the primary sidebar.

<img
  src={require('./assets/portal-sidebar-workspaces-first-org.png').default}
  alt=""
/>

2. Click your organization's name (or the corresponding icons) to reveal the **Workspaces** modal.
This displays a list of all the workspaces linked to your organization, as well as [**Link existing workspace**](/workspaces/link) and [**Create a new workspace**](/workspaces/create) options.
3. Select another [organization](/glossary#organization) name to navigate to that workspace.

The following example starts from the main **AG General inc.** workspace and selects the **AG EV-charging** workspace.

<img
  src={require('./assets/portal-sidebar-workspaces-org-list.png').default}
  alt=""
  style={{ height:500 }}
/>

:::note
The main organization workspace is indicated with a building icon.

<img
  src={require('./assets/portal-sidebar-workspaces-main-org-icon.png').default}
  alt=""
  style={{ width:300 }}
/>

The workspace you're currently in is indicated with a green checkmark.

<img
  src={require('./assets/portal-sidebar-workspaces-current-org-icon.png').default}
  alt=""
  style={{ width:300 }}
/>
:::

Now you should be in another workspace. ðŸŽ‰
