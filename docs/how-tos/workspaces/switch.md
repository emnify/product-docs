# Switch between workspaces

One benefit of having linked workspaces is that you can manage multiple organizations using one emnify account.

This guide shows you how to switch between your organizations via the workspace switcher in the emnify Portal.

:::info
Only **Administrator** user accounts of the main organization can switch between workspaces.
:::

1. [Log in to your emnify account](https://portal.emnify.com/sign).
You should see your organization's name at the top of the primary sidebar.
<img
  src={require('./assets/portal-sidebar-workspaces-first-org.png').default}
  alt=""
  style={{ width: 650 }}
/>

1. Click your organization's name (or the corresponding icons) to reveal the **Workspaces** modal.
This displays a list of all the workspaces linked to your organization, as well as **Link existing workspace** and **Create a new workspace** options.
1. Select another organization name to navigate to that workspace.

The following example starts from the main **AG General inc.** workspace and selects the **AG EV-charging** workspace.

<img
  src={require('./assets/portal-sidebar-workspaces-org-list.png').default}
  alt=""
  style={{ height: 500 }}
/>

:::note
The main organization workspace is indicated with a building icon.

<img
  src={require('./assets/portal-sidebar-workspaces-main-org-icon.png').default}
  alt=""
  style={{ width: 300 }}
/>

The workspace you're currently in is indicated with a green checkmark.

<img
  src={require('./assets/portal-sidebar-workspaces-current-org-icon.png').default}
  alt=""
  style={{ width: 300 }}
/>
:::

Now you should be in another workspace. ðŸŽ‰

  src={require('./assets/portal-sidebar-workspaces-second-org.png').default}
  alt=""
  style={{ width: 650 }}
/>
