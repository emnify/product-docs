# Link an existing workspace <span className="theme-doc-version-badge badge badge--primary beta">beta</span>

If you already have two or more [workspaces](/glossary#workspace) created, you can link these to a shared [main organization](/glossary#main-organization).
These [linked workspaces](/glossary#linked-workspaces) can be centrally or individually managed.

This guide shows you how to submit a request to link existing workspaces via the emnify Portal.
Alternatively, you can also [create a new workspace](/workspaces/create).

:::info
Only **Administrator** [user accounts](/glossary#user-account) of customers on the **Pro** plan can link existing workspaces.
:::

1. [Log in to your emnify account](https://portal.emnify.com/sign).
You should see your organization's name at the top of the primary sidebar.

<img
  src={require('./assets/portal-sidebar-workspaces.png').default}
  alt=""
/>

2. Click your organization's name (or the corresponding icons) to reveal the **Workspaces** modal.
3. Select **Link existing workspace**.

<img
  src={require('./assets/portal-sidebar-workspaces-link.png').default}
  alt=""
  style={{ height:450 }}
/>

4. Once the **Request for linking a workspace** modal appears, enter your **Contact email** and provide any details about the workspace you want to link.
5. Click **Send Request**.

If you see the **Request Sent** modal, your request has been submitted successfully. ðŸŽ‰

From there, the emnify team processes your request and contacts you to link your existing workspaces.
They can also work with you to customize them.

:::note
The process may take time, as each new workspace requires a new contract.
It usually takes 2-7 days for your workspaces to be linked.
:::

Once linked, **Administrator** user accounts of the main organization are able to [switch between workspaces](/workspaces/switch).

:::tip Feature requests
Workspaces are new to emnify, so feedback and suggestions are very welcome.
Please [open a ticket on Canny](https://emnify.canny.io/).
