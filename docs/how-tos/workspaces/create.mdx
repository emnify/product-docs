# Create a new Workspace

import PermissionsInfoPartial from './partials/_permissions-info.mdx'
import FeatureRequestsTipPartial from './partials/_feature-requests-tip.mdx'

By default, accounts with the **Pro Package** can have up to three Workspaces.

There are many reasons to opt for [multiple Workspaces](/workspaces).
For example, organizations with foreign regional subsidiaries or producing products in multiple industries.

This guide shows you how to submit a request for a new Workspace via the emnify Portal.
Alternatively, you can also [link existing Workspaces](/workspaces/link) if you already have two or more created.

<PermissionsInfoPartial action="create new" />

1. [Log in to your emnify account](https://portal.emnify.com/sign).
You should see your Workspace name at the top of the primary sidebar.

<img
  src={require('./assets/portal-sidebar-workspaces.png').default}
  alt=""
  style={{ width: 650 }}
/>

2. Click your Workspace name (or the corresponding icons) to reveal the **Workspaces** modal.
3. Select **Create a new Workspace**.

<img
  src={require('./assets/portal-sidebar-workspaces-create.png').default}
  alt=""
  style={{ width: 650 }}
/>

4. Once the **Request for a new Workspace** modal appears, enter your **Contact email** and provide more details or any requirements for the new Workspace.
5. Click **Send Request**.

:::warning
Organizations can only submit one Workspace request at a time.
If you need more than one Workspace, include those details in the body of your request.
:::

If you see the **Request Sent** modal, your request has been submitted successfully. 🎉

From there, the emnify team processes your request and contacts you to sort out the requirements.
Then, the new Workspace is created and set up for you.

:::note
The process may take time, as each new Workspace requires a new contract.
It usually takes 2-7 days for your new Workspace to be ready.
