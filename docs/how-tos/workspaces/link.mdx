# Link existing Workspaces

import PermissionsInfoPartial from './partials/_permissions-info.mdx'
import FeatureRequestsTipPartial from '../../partials/_feature-requests-tip.mdx'

This guide shows you how to submit a request to link existing Workspaces via the emnify Portal.
Each Workspace you want to link must have the [Workspaces feature](/workspaces) enabled.
Alternatively, you can also [create a new Workspace](/workspaces/create).

<PermissionsInfoPartial action="link existing" />

1. [Log in to your emnify account](https://portal.emnify.com/sign).
You should see your Workspace name at the top of the primary sidebar.

<img
  src={require('./assets/portal-sidebar-workspaces.png').default}
  alt=""
  style={{ width: 650 }}
/>

2. Click your Workspace name (or the corresponding icons) to reveal the **Workspaces** modal.
3. Select **Link existing Workspace**.

<img
  src={require('./assets/portal-sidebar-workspaces-link.png').default}
  alt=""
  style={{ height: 450 }}
/>

4. Once the **Request for linking a Workspace** modal appears, enter your **Contact email** and provide any details about the Workspace you want to link.
5. Click **Send Request**.

If you see the **Request Sent** modal, your request has been submitted successfully. ðŸŽ‰

From there, the emnify team processes your request and contacts you to link your existing Workspaces.
They can also work with you to customize them.

:::note
The process may take time, as each new Workspace requires a new contract.
It usually takes 2-7 days for your Workspaces to be linked.
:::

Once linked, invited users are able to [switch between Workspaces](/workspaces/switch).
