# Switch between workspaces

One benefit of having linked workspaces is that you can manage multiple organizations using one emnify account.

This guide shows you how to switch between your organizations via the workspace switcher in the emnify Portal.

<PermissionsInfoPartial orgData="the main organization" action="switch between" />

1. [Log in to your emnify account](https://portal.emnify.com/sign).
You should see your organization's name at the top of the primary sidebar.

<img
  src={require('./assets/portal-sidebar-workspaces.png').default}
  alt=""
  style={{ width: 650 }}
/>

2. Click your organization's name (or the corresponding icons) to reveal the **Workspaces** modal.
This displays a list of all the workspaces linked to your organization, as well as **Link existing workspace** and **Create a new workspace** options.
3. Select another organization name to navigate to that workspace.

The following example starts from the main **Example Organization** workspace and selects the **Another Organization** workspace.

  src={require('./assets/portal-sidebar-workspaces-org-list.png').default}
  alt=""
  style={{ width: 650 }}
/>

Now you should be in another workspace. ðŸŽ‰

  src={require('./assets/portal-sidebar-workspaces-second-org.png').default}
  alt=""
  style={{ width: 650 }}
/>

<FeatureRequestsTipPartial />
