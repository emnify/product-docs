# Switch between workspaces

import FeatureRequestsTipPartial from './partials/_feature-requests-tip.mdx'

This guide shows you how to switch between your [linked workspaces](/glossary#linked-workspaces) via the workspace switcher in the emnify Portal.

1. [Log in to your emnify account](https://portal.emnify.com/sign).
You should see your workspace name at the top of the primary sidebar.

<img
  src={require('./assets/portal-sidebar-workspaces.png').default}
  alt=""
  style={{ width: 650 }}
/>

2. Click your workspace name (or the corresponding icons) to reveal the **Workspaces** modal.
This displays a list of all the linked workspaces, as well as **Link existing workspace** and **Create a new workspace** options.
3. Navigate to another workspace by selecting that name.

The following example starts from the main **Example Organization** workspace and selects the **Another Organization** workspace.

<img
  src={require('./assets/portal-sidebar-workspaces-org-list.png').default}
  alt=""
  style={{ width: 650 }}
/>

Now you should be in another workspace. 🎉

<img
  src={require('./assets/portal-sidebar-workspaces-second-org.png').default}
  alt=""
  style={{ width: 650 }}
/>
