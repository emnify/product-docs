# Switch between workspaces

One benefit of having linked workspaces is that you can manage multiple independent entities using one emnify account.

This guide shows you how to switch between your workspaces via the workspace switcher in the emnify Portal.

<PermissionsInfoPartial action="switch between" />

1. [Log in to your emnify account](https://portal.emnify.com/sign).
You should see your workspace name at the top of the primary sidebar.

<img
  src={require('./assets/portal-sidebar-workspaces.png').default}
  alt=""
  style={{ width: 650 }}
/>

2. Click your workspace name (or the corresponding icons) to reveal the **Workspaces** modal.
This displays a list of all the linked workspaces, as well as **Link existing workspace** and **Create a new workspace** options.
3. Navigate to another workspace by selecting that name.

The following example starts from the main **Example Organization** workspace and selects the **Another Organization** workspace.

<img
  src={require('./assets/portal-sidebar-workspaces-org-list.png').default}
  alt=""
  style={{ width: 650 }}
/>

Now you should be in another workspace. ðŸŽ‰

<img
  src={require('./assets/portal-sidebar-workspaces-second-org.png').default}
  alt=""
  style={{ width: 650 }}
/>

<FeatureRequestsTipPartial />
