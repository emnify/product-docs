# Switch between Workspaces

This guide shows you how to switch between your [linked Workspaces](/glossary#linked-workspaces) via the Workspace switcher in the emnify Portal.

1. [Log in to your emnify account](https://portal.emnify.com/sign).
You should see your Workspace name at the top of the primary sidebar.

<Image
  srcPath={require('./assets/portal-sidebar-workspaces.png').default}
  modifiers="img--width-650"
/>

2. Click your Workspace name (or the corresponding icons) to reveal the **Workspaces** modal.
This displays a list of all the linked Workspaces, as well as **Link existing Workspace** and **Create a new Workspace** options.
3. Navigate to another Workspace by selecting that name.

The following example starts from the main **Example Organization** Workspace and selects the **Another Organization** Workspace.

<Image
  srcPath={require('./assets/portal-sidebar-workspaces-org-list.png').default}
  modifiers="img--width-650"
/>

Now you should be in another Workspace. ðŸŽ‰

<Image
  srcPath={require('./assets/portal-sidebar-workspaces-second-org.png').default}
  modifiers="img--width-650"
/>

<FeatureRequestsTipPartial />
