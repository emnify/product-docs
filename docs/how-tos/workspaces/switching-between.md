# Switching between workspaces

:::info
Only **Admin** user accounts of the **Main Organization** can switch between workspaces.
:::

1. Log in to your [emnify account](https://portal.emnify.com/sign).
You should see your organization's name at the top of the primary sidebar.

<img
  src={require('./assets/portal-sidebar-workspaces-first-org.png').default}
  alt=""
/>

2. Click this to reveal the **Workspaces** modal.
This displays a list of all the workspaces linked to your organization, as well as [**Link existing workspace**](/how-tos/workspaces/link-existing) and [**Create a new workspace**](/how-tos/workspaces/create-new) options.
3. Select another name to navigate to that workspace.

In the following example, we're starting from the main **AG General inc.** organization workspace and selecting the **AG EV-charging** workspace.

<img
  src={require('./assets/portal-sidebar-workspaces-org-list.png').default}
  alt=""
  style={{ height:500 }}
/>

:::note
The main organization workspace will be indicated with a building icon.

<img
  src={require('./assets/portal-sidebar-workspaces-main-org-icon.png').default}
  alt=""
  style={{ width:300 }}
/>

The workspace you're currently in will be indicated with a green checkmark.

<img
  src={require('./assets/portal-sidebar-workspaces-current-org-icon.png').default}
  alt=""
  style={{ width:300 }}
/>
:::

Now you should be in another workspace. ðŸŽ‰

<img
  src={require('./assets/portal-sidebar-workspaces-second-org.png').default}
  alt=""
/>
