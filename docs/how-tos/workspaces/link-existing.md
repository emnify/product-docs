# Link an existing workspace

1. Log in to your [emnify account](https://portal.emnify.com/sign).
You should see your organization's name at the top of the primary sidebar.

<img
  src={require('./assets/portal-sidebar-workspaces.png').default}
  alt=""
/>

2. Click this to reveal the **Workspaces** modal.
3. Select **Link existing workspace**.

<img
  src={require('./assets/portal-sidebar-workspaces-link.png').default}
  alt=""
  style={{ height:450 }}
/>

4. Once the **Request for linking a workspace** modal appears, fill in your **Contact email** and provide any details about the workspace you want to link.
5. Click **Send Request**.

If you see the **Request Sent** modal, your request has been submitted successfully. ðŸŽ‰

From there, our team will process your request and contact you to link your existing workspaces.
We can also work with you to customize them.

:::info
The process may take time, as each new workspace requires a new contract.
It usually takes 2â€“7 days for your workspaces to be linked.
