# How to upgrade your evaluation account


If you have ordered an evaluation pack, your account starts off on a free 60 day trial or 10â‚¬ credit (whichever comes first).
The credit included is valid for 40-100MB, depending on the country and network.
Once the credit is exhausted, you cannot use our services unless you upgrade your account.

If you are on a evaluation plan with EMnify and want to upgrade your account, please follow these steps:

1. Click on "Upgrade my Tariff" link
TODO: INSERT IMAGE

2. Select the tariff that suits your needs and click on "Get started"
TODO: INSERT IMAGE

3. Enter the organisation detalis, contact information and payment details. Click on "Save"
TODO: INSERT IMAGE

Once your evaluation account is upgraded to a paid plan, your EMnify subscription will begin and you will be billed every month automatically for your active SIM cards.
