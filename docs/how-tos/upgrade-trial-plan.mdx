# Upgrade your Trial plan

Once you've ordered your [free Trial SIMs](/quickstart/trial#order-free-trial-sims), your account starts with an issued prepaid credit for testing emnify's services.
After this credit is exhausted or the 60-day trial expires, you can only use emnify services if you upgrade your data plan and package.

## Upgrade data plan

2. Click **Choose a plan** on the sidebar or navigate directly to your organization's [**Subscription**](https://portal.emnify.com/organisation-settings/subscription) page.
