# Add IP address spaces

:::info
Only **Administrators** are allowed to add more IP address spaces.
:::

At emnify, every SIM is safeguarded with a unique static and private IP address accessible through a VPN.

To add new IP address ranges, follow these steps:

1. [Log in to your emnify account](https://portal.emnify.com/sign).
2. Navigate to **Integrations** and go to the [**IP Address Space Management**](https://portal.emnify.com/integrations#ip-address-space-management) section.
3. Click **Add IP address space**.

4. Use the dropdown menu to select an IP address space that fits your requirements.

/>

A confirmation message appears once the process is complete.

Once added, you can see the count of IP addresses allocated to your devices and the number of available IPs in the range.

:::note
The status reads **Not in use** until an IP is assigned.
Once assigned, the status changes to **Assigned to devices**.
It's not possible to remove the range if your devices use it.
:::

## Remove an IP space range

To remove an IP space range, ensure all IPs are disassociated from your devices.
Then, follow these instructions:

1. Find the range you no longer need in the [**IP Address Space Management**](https://portal.emnify.com/integrations#ip-address-space-management) section.
1. Click **Delete** (trash bin icon).
