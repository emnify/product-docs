# Enabling workspaces on your Pro plan

With our [**Pro** plan](https://portal.emnify.com/organisation-settings/subscription#plans), you can create additional workspaces with separate tariffs to adjust your business needs and optimize your device costs.

The following guides walk you through how to [create a new workspace](#create-a-new-workspace) or [link an existing one](#link-an-existing-workspace) if you already have one or more workspaces created and in use.

## Create a new workspace

1. Log in to your [emnify account](https://portal.emnify.com/sign).
You should see your organization's name at the top of the primary sidebar.

2. Click this to reveal the **Workspaces** modal.
3. Select **Create a new workspace**.

  alt=""
  style={{ height:450 }}
/>

4. Once the **Request for a new workspace** modal appears, fill in your **Contact email** and provide more details or any requirements for the new workspace.
5. Click **Send Request**.

:::caution
Organizations can only request one new workspace at a time.
:::

If you see the **Request Sent** modal, your request has been submitted successfully. ðŸŽ‰

From there, our team will process your request and contact you to sort out the requirements.
Then, we'll create and set up the new workspace for you.

:::info
The process may take time, as each new workspace requires a new contract.
It usually takes 2â€“7 days for your new workspace to be ready.
