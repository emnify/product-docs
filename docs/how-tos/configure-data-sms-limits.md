# How to configure Data and SMS Limits

This article will quickly guide you to a very important function that can let you have control over your devices usage policies and avoid extra-consumption in the monthly bill.
When you set a data limit for your devices, please ensure that once the limit is reached, your devices do not try to connect every few seconds.
It is your responsibility to introduce a random back off timer.

1. Click on Device Policies
TODO: INSERT IMAGE

2. Open your desired Service Policy
TODO: INSERT IMAGE

3. Activate "Usage limits"
     TODO: INSERT LIMITS
   
4. For DATA open the drop-menu and select the MB limit based on the expected consumption of your device.
     TODO: INSERT IMAGE

The limit will be applied to all the devices which are associated with the selected Service Policy.
The limit is valid for the current month and will reset to 0 MB on the first day of each month.

:::warning
Do not switch off "Devices may use data" this will completely disable data connectivity and your devices will go offline!
:::

Once you set the limit wait for the confirmation pop up to appear on your screen:
TODO: INSERT IMAGE

5. For SMS open the drop down Menu and select the SMS limit based on the usage of your device (MO: SMS sent - MT: SMS received)
TODO: INSERT IMAGE

Example:
TODO: INSERT IMAGE

:::note
The limit will be applied to all the devices which are associated with the selected Service Policy
:::

The limit is valid for the current month and will reset to 0 SMSes on the first day of each month.
Once you set the limit wait for the confirmation popping-up in your screen:
TODO: INSERT IMAGE

E.G. your Service Policy is set up to limit the monthly usage of your device to 10 MB and 5 SMS MO/MT, it will appear like this:
TODO: INSERT IMAGE

6. Switch-Off the Limits
For both limits, just disable the "Usage limits" toggle again
TODO: INSERT IMAGE

7. Disable data limits only
From the drop Down Menu select: No Limit

**WARNING:** Do not switch off "Devices may use data" this will completely disable data connectivity and your devices will go offline!

TODO: INSERT IMAGE

8. Disable SMS limits
From the drop Down Menu select: No Limit

**Note:** If you want to completely do not allow your device to send/receive SMS, switch off both or one of the 2 functions:
