# Setup SSO with Google Cloud Platform

This guide walks through enabling single sign-on (SSO), so your organization can access the emnify Portal using your Google Cloud Platform credentials.

**Prerequisites:**

- A Google account that's a user within a [Google Cloud Platform organization](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-organization)
- An [emnify account](/quickstart) using the same email address as the one used to sign in to Google 

:::caution
If your email address in the emnify Portal differs from the one used to log in to Google, this setup won't work.
You can verify your email in [**User Settings**](https://portal.emnify.com/user-settings).

Instead, add an additional user with the **Administrator** role.
To do this, go to **Workspace settings**&nbsp;<span aria-label="and then">></span> [**Users**](https://portal.emnify.com/organisation-settings/users).

## Register emnify in Google

First, you need to register emnify in the [Google Cloud Platform console](https://console.developers.google.com/) and retrieve an OAuth 2.0 client ID and client secret.

### Select or create an emnify project

Log in with your Google account and navigate to the [APIs & Services dashboard](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/dashboard).

Select your organization's project for managing OAuth credentials for emnify.

If you don't already have a designated project, create one with the following steps:

1. Click **New Project**.
1. If prompted, agree to the terms of service.
1. Enter a **Project name** (for example, "emnify SSO") and **Location**.
1. Click **Create**, then you should land on the **Enabled APIs & Services** page.
1. In the APIs & Services navigation bar, click **OAuth consent screen**.
1. Choose the [**User Type**](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/10311615#user-type) for your project.
1. Specify app information about emnify (**App Name**, **User support email**, and **Developer contact information** are necessary, but all other fields are optional).
1. (Optional) Define any **Scopes** or **Test Users**.
1. Click **Save and Continue** to proceed.
1. Navigate to the summary screen, review your settings, and click **Back to Dashboard**.

### Get an OAuth client ID and Secret

Use the **Credentials** option to retrieve the OAuth client ID and secret that you'll enter into the emnify Portal.

1. Head to **Credentials** in the APIs & Services navigation bar.
1. Click **+ Create Credentials** (on the top next to the page header), then select the `OAuth client ID` option.
1. In the **Application type** list, select `Web application`.
1. Enter a **Name** (for example, "emnify Portal" or "Enterprise Portal").
1. Set an **Authorized redirect URI** with the value: `https://prod-e5.okta.com/oauth2/v1/authorize/callback`
1. Click **Create** and wait for the **OAuth client created** modal to appear.
1. Copy the displayed values (you'll need them later) or download the provided JSON.

:::tip
You can access your client ID and secret at any time in your Google Cloud Platform console on the **Credentials** page.

## Configure the emnify Portal

1. [Log in to the emnify Portal](https://portal.emnify.com/sign/).
1. Go to **Workspace settings** (building icon) in the top-level navigation and click [**Single Sign-On**](https://portal.emnify.com/organisation-settings/federation).
1. If you need SSO enabled for your account, [contact emnify support](https://support.emnify.com/). 
Otherwise, click **Add** under the Google SSO provider.
1. Enter the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** you copied earlier, then click **Create and Activate**.
1. Once you're back on **Single Sign-On**, you should see Google listed as a **Provider**.
1. Finally, click **Verify Integration** and follow the prompts.

:::caution
You must complete the final step and verify the provider to configure SSO.
