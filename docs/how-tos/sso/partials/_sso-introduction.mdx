This guide walks through enabling single sign-on (SSO), so your Workspace can access the emnify Portal using your {props.provider} credentials.

## Prerequisites

- {props.prereq}
- An [emnify account](/quickstart) using the same email address as the one used to sign in to {props.platform}

:::warning
If your email address used in the emnify Portal differs from the one used to log in to {props.platform}, this setup won't work.
You can verify your email in [**User Settings**](https://portal.emnify.com/user-settings).

Instead, add an additional user with the **Administrator** role.
To do this, go to **Workspace settings**&nbsp;<span aria-label="and then">></span> [**Users**](https://portal.emnify.com/organisation-settings/users).
