# Change the assigned data allowance

Data plans and the associated allowances are managed within [coverage policies](/portal/device-policies#coverage-policies).

With the **Pro Package**, you can manage up to 6 data plans.
Those with a **Plus Package** can manage up to 4 data plans.

Once a data plan has been configured on your emnify account, make sure your coverage policies have been adjusted correctly to take advantage of data allowances.

## View your coverage policies

1. [Log in to your emnify account](https://portal.emnify.com/sign).
1. Navigate to **Device Policies**, then scroll to [**Coverage Policies**](https://portal.emnify.com/device-policies#coverage-policies).
1. Adjust your existing policies under **Details** or select **New coverage policy** to create a new one.

:::info
Once configured, you need to add a data allowance for your coverage policies to use them with devices.
:::

## Change the data allowance

If you notice that one of your devices uses more (or less) data than expected, you can update its assigned data allowance any time during the month.

:::note
Any changes are reflected on your invoice within a few hours.
:::

### Individual device

1. Navigate to your [**Connected Devices**](https://portal.emnify.com/connected-devices).
2. Decide which device you want to adjust and click **Details**.

In the following example, the device switches from **Europe 1 MB** included to **Europe 500 MB** included.

### Multiple devices in bulk

2. Select multiple devices by clicking the checkboxes next to the device **Name**.

3. Locate the **More** dropdown menu on the banner and select **Change Coverage Policy**.

4. Once the **Change Coverage Policy** modal appears, use the **Coverage Policy** dropdown to choose the policy you want to assign to the selected devices and click **Save**.

In the preceding example, the two selected devices (**Walking Mobile** and **TravelSpot**) are assigned to **New coverage policy**.

## Change the data plan

You can also change the coverage (for example, switching from **Americas** to **APAC**) anytime during the month.

:::note
When creating the invoice, emnify confirms which data plan the device is assigned to and bill your account accordingly.
Any changes are reflected on your invoice within a few hours.
:::

To change a coverage policy's data plan in the Portal, follow these steps:
