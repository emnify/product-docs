# Configure data and SMS limits

Limits are an important function that lets you control your device's usage policies and avoid extra consumption in your monthly bill.

:::info
When you set a data limit for your devices, you need to make sure your devices don't try to connect every few seconds once the limit is reached.
It's your responsibility to introduce a random backup timer.

## Activate limits

### Data

1. [Log in to your emnify account](https://portal.emnify.com/sign).
2. Navigate to **Device Policies**.
3. Find your desired service policy in the **Service Policies** section and click **Details**.
4. Click the **Usage limits** toggle to the on position.
5. Open the **Data Limit** dropdown menu and select the MB limit based on the expected consumption of your device.

Once you set the limit, wait for the confirmation pop-up to appear on your screen.

:::note
The limit is applied to all the devices associated with the selected service policy.
The limit is valid for the current month and resets to 0 MB on the first day of each month.
