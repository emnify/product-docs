:::info
When you set a data limit for your devices, you need to make sure your devices don't try to connect every few seconds once the limit is reached.
It's your responsibility to introduce a random backup timer.
:::

## Set limits

### Data \{#set-limits-data}

<SetLimitInstructionsPartial
  limitType="data"
  limitValue="MB"
  dropdownLabel="Data Limit"
  toggleLabel="Devices may use data"
  exampleLimit="1 MB per 1 month"
/>

:::warning
Don't switch off the **Devices may use data** toggle as this completely turns off data connectivity and takes your devices offline.
:::

### SMS \{#set-limits-sms}

<SetLimitInstructionsPartial
  limitType="sms"
  limitValue="SMS"
  dropdownLabel="SMS Sending Limit or SMS Receiving Limit"
  toggleLabel="Devices may send SMS (SMS MO) or Devices may receive SMS (SMS MT)"
  exampleLimit="10 SMS per 1 month"
/>

## Turn off limits

### Data \{#turn-off-limits-data}

<TurnOffLimitInstructionsPartial
  limitType="data"
  dropdownLabel="Data Limit"
/>

:::warning
Don't switch off the **Devices may use data** toggle as this completely turns off data connectivity and takes your devices offline.
:::

### SMS \{#turn-off-limits-sms}

<TurnOffLimitInstructionsPartial
  limitType="sms"
  dropdownLabel="SMS Sending Limit or SMS Receiving Limit"
/>

:::note
If you don't want your device to send or receive SMS, switch off both or one of the toggles.
