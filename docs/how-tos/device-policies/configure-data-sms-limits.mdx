# Configure data and SMS limits

Limits are an important function that lets you control your device's usage policies and avoid extra consumption in your monthly bill.

:::info
When you set a data limit for your devices, you need to make sure your devices don't try to connect every few seconds once the limit is reached.
It's your responsibility to introduce a random backup timer.
:::

## Set limits

### Data

1. [Log in to your emnify account](https://portal.emnify.com/sign).
2. Navigate to [**Device Policies**](https://portal.emnify.com/device-policies).
3. Find your desired service policy in the **Service Policies** section and click **Details**.

:::note
The limit is applied to all the devices associated with the selected service policy.
The limit is valid for the current month and resets to 0 MB on the first day of each month.

:::warning
Don't switch off the **Devices may use data** toggle as this completely turns off data connectivity and takes your devices offline.
