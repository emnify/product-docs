# Configure data and SMS limits

import SetLimitInstructionsPartial from './partials/_set-limit-instructions.mdx'
import TurnOffLimitInstructionsPartial from './partials/_turn-off-limit-instructions.mdx'

Limits are an important function that lets you control your device's usage policies and avoid extra consumption in your monthly bill.

:::info
When you set a data limit for your devices, you need to make sure your devices don't try to connect every few seconds once the limit is reached.
It's your responsibility to introduce a random backup timer.

## Set limits

### Data \{#set-limits-data}

<SetLimitInstructionsPartial
  limitType="data"
  toggleLabel="Devices may use data"
  usageType="Data"
  sectionTitle="Cellular data limit"
/>

:::warning
Don't switch off the **Devices may use data** toggle as this completely turns off data connectivity and takes your devices offline.
:::

### SMS \{#set-limits-sms}

<SetLimitInstructionsPartial
  limitType="SMS"
  toggleLabel="SMS outbound or SMS inbound"
  usageType="SMS"
  sectionTitle="SMS outbound limit or SMS inbound limit"
/>

## Turn off limits

### Data \{#turn-off-limits-data}

<TurnOffLimitInstructionsPartial
  sectionTitle="Cellular data limit"
  limitType="data"
/>

:::warning
Don't switch off the **Devices may use data** toggle as this completely turns off data connectivity and takes your devices offline.
:::

### SMS \{#turn-off-limits-sms}

<TurnOffLimitInstructionsPartial
  sectionTitle="SMS outbound limit or SMS inbound limit"
  limitType="SMS"
/>

:::note
If you don't want your device to send or receive SMS, switch off both or one of the toggles.
