You have the option to configure your own DNS settings, no matter if it's a public or a private server.
DNS settings can be changed in the emnify Portal.
By default, emnify uses the Google DNS 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4.

:::note
Utilizing a private DNS server that isn't accessible via the public internet requires establishing a private network with the device or a network where the private DNS server is situated.
This can be accomplished using Cloud Connect through Amazon Transit Gateway or IPsec.

See [DNS Filtering with emnify Cloud Connect and AWS Route53](https://www.emnify.com/developer-blog/dns-filtering) on the emnify Developer Blog for step-by-step instructions.
