# Create a new coverage policy

1. [Log in to your emnify account](https://portal.emnify.com/sign).
1. Navigate to the [**Coverage Policies**](https://portal.emnify.com/device-policies#coverage-policies) section of **Device Policies**.
1. Select **New coverage policy**.
1. Replace **New coverage policy** with the name of your policy and add a **Description**.
   Then, choose a **Data Plan** and **Data allowance** from the available options.
1. Finally, click **Create**.

By default, connectivity is disabled, and any devices assigned to this coverage policy are blocked from all networks.
You need to enable at least one **Coverage area** for your devices to connect.

Changes save automatically.

:::tip
Creating multiple coverage policies lets you differentiate between device types based on their coverage needs and the associated costs.

## Delete a coverage policy

Click the trash bin icon next to **Details** to remove a coverage policy.

## Next steps

Coverage policies only become useful after you start assigning devices to them.
For instructions on how to do this in the emnify Portal, see [Assign devices to a policy](/how-tos/assign-devices-to-policies).
