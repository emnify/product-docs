# Create a new service policy

1. [Log in to your emnify account](https://portal.emnify.com/sign).
1. Navigate to **Device Policies**.
   **Service policies** are in the top section of the page.
1. Select **New service policy**.
1. Replace **New service policy** with the name of your policy, then add a **Description** and edit the **Configuration**.

Changes save automatically.

:::tip
Creating one policy per use case or device type helps you adjust and save your device settings based on the demands of a particular use case.
:::

## Delete a service policy

Click the trash bin icon next to **Details** to remove a service policy.

## Next steps

Service policies only become useful after you start assigning devices to them.
For instructions on how to do this in the emnify Portal, see [Assign devices to a policy](/how-tos/assign-devices-to-policies).
