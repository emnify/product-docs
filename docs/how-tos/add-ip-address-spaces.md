At EMnify, every SIM is safeguarded with a unique Static and Private IP address, which is accessible through a VPN.

To incorporate new IP address ranges, please adhere to the straightforward steps below:

1. Navigate to the 'Integrations' section.
   TODO: INSERT IMAGE

2. Scroll to the 'IP Address Space Management' area and select the 'Add IP Address Space' button in orange.
   TODO: INSERT IMAGE

3. Use the dropdown menu to select an IP address space that fits your requirements.
   TODO: INSERT IMAGE

   A confirmation message will appear once the process is complete.

4. After the addition, the summary will display the count of IP addresses allocated to your devices and the number of available IPs in the range.
   Note that the status will read "not in use" until an IP is assigned.
   Once assigned, the status changes to "assigned to devices" and the range cannot be removed as long as it's in use.
   TODO: INSERT IMAGE

6. To remove an IP space range, ensure all IPs within it are no longer associated with any devices.
   Then, simply click 'remove' to delete the range.
   TODO: INSERT IMAGE

   A confirmation message will pop up once the IP range is successfully removed.
