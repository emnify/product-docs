# Set up multi-inclusive volumes

emnify introduced a multi-inclusive volumes feature, allowing you to manage different tariffs and data plans from a single account. 
These volumes are managed within [coverage policies](/portal/device-policies#coverage-policies).

With the **Pro** plan, you can manage as many tariff profiles and data plans as you need.
Those on a **Plus** plan can manage up to 4. 

Once multi-inclusive volumes have been enabled on your emnify account, please ensure that your coverage policies have been adjusted correctly to take advantage of this setup.

## View your coverage policies

Log in to your [emnify account](https://portal.emnify.com/sign) and navigate to the [**Device Policies**](https://portal.emnify.com/device-policies) page.

Then, go to your **Coverage Policies**.

You can either adjust your existing policies under **Details** or create new ones by clicking **New coverage policy**. 

The following example shows the details of the coverage policy named **Europe 500 MB**. 
This coverage policy has **500 MB** in **Europe Basic (Main zone)** included on the **Regional Pro EUR** tariff.

:::info
Once enabled, you need to configure an inclusive volume for your coverage policies to use them with devices.
:::

## Change the inclusive volume

If you notice that one of your devices uses more (or less) data than expected, you can update its assigned inclusive volume any time during the month. 

:::info
Any changes are reflected on your invoice within a few hours.
:::

### Individual device

1. Navigate to the **Connected Devices** page.

In the preceding example, the two selected devices (**Walking Mobile** and **TravelSpot**) are assigned to **New coverage policy**.

## Change the tariff

You can also change the tariff (for example, switching from **Global Basic Zone A** to **Regional Pro Americas**) anytime during the month. 

:::info
When creating the invoice, emnify confirms which tariff the device is assigned to and bill your account accordingly.
Any changes are reflected on your invoice within a few hours.
