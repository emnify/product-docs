# Change the assigned data allowance

Data allowances are managed within [coverage policies](/portal/device-policies#coverage-policies).

With the **Pro Package**, you can manage as many data plans as you need.
Those with a **Plus Package** can manage up to 4 data plans.

Once a data plan has been configured on your emnify account, make sure your coverage policies have been adjusted correctly to take advantage of data allowances.

## View your coverage policies

1. [Log in to your emnify account](https://portal.emnify.com/sign).
1. Navigate to **Device Policies**, then scroll to [**Coverage Policies**](https://portal.emnify.com/device-policies#coverage-policies).
1. Adjust your existing policies under **Details** or select **New coverage policy** to create a new one.

:::info
Once configured, you need to add a data allowance for your coverage policies to use them with devices.
:::

## Change the data allowance

If you notice that one of your devices uses more (or less) data than expected, you can update its assigned data allowance any time during the month.

:::info
Any changes are reflected on your invoice within a few hours.
:::

### Individual device

1. Navigate to your [**Connected Devices**](https://portal.emnify.com/connected-devices).
1. Decide which device you want to adjust and click **Details**.

## Change the data plan

You can also change the coverage (for example, switching from **Americas** to **APAC**) anytime during the month.

When creating the invoice, emnify confirms which data plan the device is assigned to and bill your account accordingly.
Any changes are reflected on your invoice within a few hours.
