# Use the emnify SMS console

emnify's SMS console allows individuals without direct access to the emnify Portal to interact with a device using SMS.
The console is designed to enable the configuration and troubleshooting of a device.
This functionality is particularly interesting for third parties installing and managing devices for manufacturers.

:::warning
Currently, the availability of SMS console is limited to customers of emnify's Brazilian entity.
Access for additional customers is coming soon.

## Enable console access for your customers

Access to the SMS console is managed through emnify's tagging mechanism.
Follow these steps to enable access for your customer:

1. [Log in to your emnify account](https://portal.emnify.com/sign).
1. Navigate to your [**Connected Devices**](https://portal.emnify.com/connected-devices).
1. Find the device you want to manage using the SMS console and click **Details**.
1. Select **+ Add tag** under the device name.
1. Tag the devices using the following syntax:

```txt
sms-UNIQUE_IDENTIFIER
```

Replace _`UNIQUE_IDENTIFIER`_ with a unique string of letters and numbers to identify the tagged devices.
Choosing a proper unique identifier is essential to the security of the device and your customers' data.

:::danger
Never use an email address or other identifiable information as a unique identifier.
Instead, use a random string of numbers and letters.
For example `sms-939ffa9eksdf`
:::

Once a device is tagged using this syntax, you can manage it using the SMS console.

1. Navigate to [https://sms.emnify.com](https://sms.emnify.com)
