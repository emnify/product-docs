# Set up a Zapier SMS integration

Instead of implementing the APIs in your application, emnify and Zapier provide a no-code alternative to automate SMS workflows.
Zapier has a concept of triggers and actions—when a trigger happens, multiple actions can be based on it—taking content from previous steps.

Sending SMS to your devices is available as an action in Zapier.
Follow these steps to configure this integration via the emnify Portal:

1. [Log in to your emnify account](https://portal.emnify.com/sign).
1. Navigate to **Integrations**&nbsp;<span aria-label="and then">></span> [**No-Code-Workflows**](https://portal.emnify.com/integrations#no-code-workflows)
1. Find the integration you want to set up, then click **Use this Zap**.

  alt="Portal screenshot from the Integrations page. The featured integration reads, 'Enable devices and send SMS via emnify from newly caught webhooks. emnify + Webhooks by Zapier'. Next to the text, there's a 'Use this Zap' button."
/>

There, you'll find a predefined Zap consisting of three steps with interactive instructions on configuring or modifying the steps for your specific needs.
For example:

1. Catch hook in webhooks by Zapier (Trigger)
1. Enable a device in emnify (Action)
1. Send an SMS in emnify (Action)
