# Send SMS via the emnify Portal

You can use the emnify Portal to send and receive SMS messages to and from your devices.
Because SMS doesn't require a data connection, SMS is one of the ways you can configure the [APN](/glossary#apn) for [GPS trackers](/apn-configuration/gps-trackers) and [industrial routers](/apn-configuration/industrial-routers).

## Individual device

To send SMS to a single device, follow these steps:

1. [Log in to your emnify account](https://portal.emnify.com/sign).
2. Navigate to your [**Connected Devices**](https://portal.emnify.com/connected-devices) and find the device you want to receive the SMS.
3. [Open the SMS console](/portal/sms#open-the-sms-console).
4. Write your message text, configure the **Source**, and then click **Send** (paper plane icon).

The SMS history and input field at the bottom of the SMS console is similar to the layout and features found in most mobile messaging apps.

## Multiple devices in bulk

Selecting several devices on the Portal and simultaneously sending SMS is also possible.

1. Navigate to your [**Connected Devices**](https://portal.emnify.com/connected-devices).
2. Search for the devices where you wish to block an operator and select the checkbox next to every relevant device.

3. A new menu at the top of the page provides bulk operations.
Select **SMS**.

This SMS interface doesn't show a history of messages.
However, you receive a brief notification regarding the status of the SMS sent to the selected devices.
