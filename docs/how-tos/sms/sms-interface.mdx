# Configure the SMS interface

The **SMS interface** specifies how and where to forward SMS from devices under this service policy.

The following connections are available:

- [**Web Portal**](/how-tos/send-sms-portal) (default) - Access SMS directly in the emnify Portal
- [**Webhook**](#webhook) - Configure a URL to receive SMS sent from your device
- [**SMPP**](#smpp) - Set up a direct SMPP connection to emnify

## Webhook

You can use the SMS webhook to receive SMS and delivery notifications in your application.

### Add webhook

1. [Log in to your emnify account](https://portal.emnify.com/sign).
2. Navigate to your [**Device Policies**](https://portal.emnify.com/device-policies).
3. Under **Service Policies**, choose the policy you want to update and expand the policy details.
4. In **SMS**, find the **SMS interface** section.
  By default, the badge next to the section title reads **Web Portal**.
5. Click **Edit** (pencil icon) to open the **SMS console settings** configuration modal.
6. In the **SMS console** list, select **Webhook**.
7. In **Add Webhook to forward SMS to**, provide the following:

- In the **URL** field, enter the public URL of your server to receive API requests.
- In the **Secret key** field, enter a key to prevent unauthorized access and your server can decline requests if the key is incorrect.

8. Review your configuration, then click **Add Webhook**.

:::warning
The secret key isn't displayed after you add the webhook.
Keep this key in a safe place.
