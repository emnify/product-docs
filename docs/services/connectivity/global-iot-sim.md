# emnify IoT eSIM

emnify provides eSIMs that are built specifically for IoT solutions.

Compared to regular operator SIMs, emnify eSIMs come in different quality grades that are more durable.
They can be updated over the air (OTA) using different eSIM remote SIM provisioning technologies and come in different form factors.


## M2M eSIM



Every new SIM you order from **emnify** is an M2M eSIM (compliant with SGP.01, SGP.02, and SGP.16).
The M2M eSIM is also referred to as an [embedded universal integrated circuit card (eUICC)](/glossary#euicc) and comes in different [form factors](#form-factors).
Unlike a regular SIM (UICC), an eUICC can be updated [over the air (OTA)](/glossary#ota) using different eSIM remote SIM provisioning technologies.
Because M2M eSIMs can be updated with new configurations or profiles, this eliminates the need for SIM swaps.

### Main benefits

As a key component of the emnify IoT SuperNetwork service, the new emnify IoT eSIM unlocks a number of benefits for our customers, including:  
1. Optimized coverage and network selection: connect to the best range of networks for your specific needs, ensuring you take advantage of expanding coverage options without SIM swaps. 
1. Future-proof connectivity: get access to the latest network technologies and have the best possible connection, including satellite NB-IoT and 5G. 
1. Streamlined network access to new markets: network regulations are changing continuously. To expand into regulated countries, the emnify IoT eSIM will enable you to comply with local laws without changing your setup.

:::note
To do an over-the-Air update, your IoT device and the network needs to support SMS. Please note that devices that only support NB-IoT lack SMS support and therefore, the SIM cannot be updated.

## Form factors

emnify [M2M eSIMs](#m2m-esim) are available in the following form factors:

| Form factor         | Dimensions             |
|---------------------|------------------------|
| **2FF** (Mini SIM)  | 15 x 25 x 0.75 mm      |
| **3FF** (Micro SIM) | 12 x 15 x 0.75 mm      |
| **4FF** (Nano SIM)  | 8.8 x 12.3 x 0.75 mm   |
| **MFF2** (eSIM)     | 5 x 6 x 0.75 mm, 8 pin |

:::note
MFF2 eSIMs can be soldered onto a device and aren't readily removable.

## Multi-IMSI applet

EMnify eSIM cards come equipped with a multi-IMSI applet. 
This technology not only ensures there's no negative impact on device performance but also enables devices to select the best network dynamically based on their location. 
As a result, EMnify offers access to a more extensive range of networks, including the largest global [LPWAN](global-iot-network#lpwan-lte-mnb-iot) (LTE-M and NB-IoT) footprint, ensuring regulatory network access in over 100 countries.

The eSIM stores cellular provider information from multiple operators. 
EMnify has established roaming agreements and local contracts with operators globally and collaborates with partner operators to enhance network coverage and provide fallback options during network outages.

Here's how the multi-IMSI applet functions:  

- EMnify has both its own operator identity ([IMSI](/glossary#imsi)) and the IMSI of partner operators stored on the SIM card.  
- Each IMSI or partner operator usually supports access to more than one network in a country. 
- The applet contains a preferred IMSI list for each country.  
 For example, if IMSI _X_ is prioritized for country _A_, but fails to establish a connection, IMSI _Y_ is used as a fallback.   
- If a device travels to country _A_, the applet switches to the preferred IMSI for that location, ensuring continuous connectivity even during service disruptions.

The selection of the preferred IMSI for each country considers several factors:  

- Acceptance of permanent roaming in the country. 
- The IMSI with the most network partnerships in the country. 
- Availability of specific radio access types (e.g., LTE, NB-IoT, LTE-M) or features such as PSM/eDRX.
