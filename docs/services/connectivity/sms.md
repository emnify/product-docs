# SMS

Short Message Services (SMS) were one of the first cellular services made available after voice.
SMS is still very relevant for IoT use cases – as SMS provides a simple, inexpensive way to configure the device remotely without the need for a data connection.
A typical use case is the configuration of the APN setting via SMS.

The emnify platform supports:

- Mobile originated (MO) SMS – SMS sent from the device with the emnify SIM
- Mobile terminated (MT) SMS – SMS that are destined for a device with the emnify SIM
- Peer-to-Peer (P2P) SMS – SMS sent from a device with any SIM to a device with the emnify SIM
- Application- to-peer (A2P) SMS – The SMS is sent and received on an application

The scenarios above can be activated and deactivated in the device policies to prevent misuse (e.g., P2P SMS).

You can send and receive SMS of your devices through 3 different interfaces:

- [emnify Portal](#emnify-portal)
- [emnify SMS API and webhook](#emnify-sms-rest-api-and-webhook)
- [Zapier SMS integration](#zapier-sms-integration)

## emnify Portal

In the [emnify Portal](https://portal.emnify.com/) → [**Connected Devices**](https://portal.emnify.com/connected-devices) you can access the SMS console and directly send SMS to the devices. 
The sender can be configured as well as the console will show if the SMS is delivered or not.
You will see all SMS that the device receives sends out.

For sending SMS messages to a single device, select **Details**:

An SMS/Message icon will appear to the right of the device name.

The SMS history and input field at the bottom of the SMS console is similiar to the layout and functionality found in most mobile messaging apps.

When you select (check) one or more devices in the list of [**Connected Devices**](https://portal.emnify.com/connected-devices), a group of menu items will appear that includes **SMS**.

This SMS interface does not show a history of messages.

However, you will receive a brief notification regarding the status of the SMS sent to the selected devices.

## emnify SMS REST API and webhook

For sending SMS through the REST API, check out the [Sending and receiving SMS](#_sending_and_receiving_sms) section.

For receiving SMS and delivery notifications for SMS in your application, you can use the SMS webhook which can be configured under [**Device Policies**](https://portal.emnify.com/device-policies) → **Service Policies** → **SMS Interface**.


<img
  src={require('./assets/portal-device-policies-sms-interface-webhook.png').default}
  alt=""
  style={{ width: 800 }}
/>

Select **Webhook**, then select  **Configure Webhook**:

<img
  src={require('./assets/portal-device-policies-configure-webhook.png').default}
  alt=""
  style={{ width: 399 }}
/>

In the **Add Webhook** dialog, provide the webhook URL and an optional secret key: 

<img
  src={require('./assets/portal-device-policies-add-webhook.png').default}
  alt=""
  style={{ width: 856 }}
/>

When you want to send an SMS from the device to your application, your device should send the SMS to an invalid [MSISDN](#msisdn) with 8 digits or less.
The SMS will then be delivered over the webhook.

## Zapier SMS integration

Instead of implementing the APIs in your application, emnify and Zapier provide a no-code alternative to automate SMS workflows.
Zapier has a concept of triggers and actions – when a trigger happens multiple actions can be based on it – taking content from previous steps.
Sending SMS to your devices is available as an action in Zapier.
In the [**No-Code-Workflows**](https://portal.emnify.com/integrations#no-code-workflows) list on the [**Integrations** page of the emnify Portal](https://portal.emnify.com/integrations), select the following:

![Portal screenshot from the Integrations page. The featured integration reads, "Enable devices and send SMS via emnify from newly caught webhooks. emnify + Webhooks by Zapier". Next to the text, there's a "Use this Zap" button.](assets/portal-integrations-sms-webhooks-zapier.png)

There you will find a predefined Zap consisting of 3 steps with interactive instructions on how to configure it or modify the steps for your specific needs:

1. Catch Hook in Webhooks by Zapier (Trigger)
1. Enable a Device in emnify (Action)
1. Send an SMS in emnify (Action)
