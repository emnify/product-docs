# Data Streamer

Before each device can send data to an application, it needs to communicate with the mobile network to ensure that the data is allowed to be sent over the network.
This communication happens through signaling events which are usually hidden from the application.

With the emnify Data Streamer, this connectivity metadata is made available to your cloud platform or self-developed software stacks in near real time.
Using one of the many integrations provides you with complete network transparency, not only to triage and resolve issues quickly, but also to build your own application or business logic based on provided information.

Moreover, this integration provides insights for IoT remote monitoring and anomaly detection or detailed information about service (data, SMS) usage and cost per device.
Additionally, data streams can also be configured to reflect events generated by the emnify platform when your users perform billing related updates, order SIMs or perform other operations.

Use cases:

- Connectivity metadata integrated into operational dashboards for real-time monitoring
- Allows faster triaging between device, connectivity and application issue
- Get insights about network attachment, data and roaming issues or when the device has surpassed its service limit
- Get an overview of service usage and cost per device

You can configure the type of content delivered by the data stream. You may choose between receiving usage data or event data.

## Events

The emnify platform generates several types of events.
Events are often used as triggers for custom business processes, for monitoring and as an input for custom billing systems.
They provide information about lifecycle transitions and configuration changes.
Events can be distinguished as normal/expected, unusual, and critical events through the event severity (INFO, WARN, CRITICAL).

Events can be classified as follows:

1. Network attachment lifecycle events (SIM attaching/detaching to a visited network, failed attachment attempts with reason)
1. Data connection lifecycle events (PDP context lifecycle; SIM on-/offline, failed attempts with reason)
1. SIM lifecycle events (activation, suspension, deletion)
1. Limit enforcement events (cost/volume limits, prepaid volume, endpoint quota lifecycle events such as quota threshold reached/quota used up, organization-wide or endpoint specific)
1. Platform authentication events (user/application authentication failed, support access granted, MFA activated/deactivated, password reset requested.)
1. CloudConnect lifecycle events (resource-share created, breakout available, breakout terminated, state changed; for TGW, VPN, IPsec.)
1. OpenVPN lifecycle events (authentication, connected/disconnected)
1. Organization and billing config related events (Self-Signup performed, new user invited, billing config updated, organization data updated, payment could not be settled, credit card will expire.)
1. Usage Tariff and Tariff Plan related events (Usage Tariff changed, end of evaluation period reached, inclusive volume booked/extended.)
1. SIM order events

## Usage data

Usage data records get generated when endpoints consume data or SMS services.
They provide information about the used service, visited network, volume, and cost.
Usage data streams are often used for monitoring and analyzing the data consumption and as input for custom billing system.

## Connection types

You can stream this data to your server, a third-party web service or push the data to one of the pre-integrated cloud services.

Multiple independent data streams can be created using any connection type and all of them will operate in parallel.
Each data stream can be configured to push data to a separate platform for consumption and processing.

For example, one stream may be connected to a network monitoring system, another can connect to a data analytics platform, and another can be synced with Amazon S3 for archiving, all at the same time.

The integration guides for the Data Streamer can be found [here](#_integration_guides).

## Management interfaces

Data Streams can be managed by using the [emnify Portal](https://portal.emnify.com/) or by using the [emnify API](https://cdn.emnify.net/api/doc/swagger.html?__hstc=115846617.4e595f58851491bb8576507ce2561f79.1670194662635.1670424207784.1670429175064.6&__hssc=115846617.2.1670429175064&__hsfp=3017379904).
