# 2G (GSM/GPRS/EDGE)

GSM/GPRS remains one of the most prevalent IoT technologies.Despite its throughput ( with GPRS max. at 120kbps and EDGE at max. 1Mbps), it proves more than adequate for many IoT use cases.
The affordability of modules (costing less than $10) and the widespread coverage available in over 200 countries contribute to its enduring popularity.

Deploying GSM/GPRS for IoT use cases is relatively straightforward because operators worldwide utilize only four frequency bands:

<div align="center">
  
|     | frequency band |
| --- | --- |
| in the Americas | - B2 (1900MHz) <br/> - B5 (850MHz) |
| in the rest of world | - B3 (1800MHz) <br/> - B8 (900MHz) |

</div>

A a result, module manufacturers offer dual-band modules that can be used either in Americas or Rest of World. Alternatively, quad-band modules are available for global deployment.

However, it's important to note that GSM/GPRS is gradually being phased out in several countries to make room for newer technologies.
[More than 60 networks have discontinued or announced to discontinue GSM technology](https://www.emnify.com/en/resources/global-2g-phase-out).
