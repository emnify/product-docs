# 3G: UMTS/WCDMA/HPSA/HSDPA

3G technologies such as UMTS, WCDMA, HSDPA, and HSUPA have emerged in response to the growing demand for higher data speeds.
These technologies build upon the foundation of GSM, with many components of the GSM/GPRS core network and signaling being reused, with the most significant differences occurring in the radio component.

Similar to 2G, deploying 3G modules is a relatively straightforward process since operators worldwide utilize only five different frequency bands (with the exception of Japan and China).
This means that most UMTS modules can be deployed globally.

The frequency bands used include:

|  frequency band   |  |
| --- | --- |
| B1 (2100MHz) | the primary UMTS band worldwide | 
| B2 (1900MHz) | used in the Americas |
| B4 (1700MHz) | used in the Americas |
| B5 (850MHz)  | used in Australia and the Americas |
| B8 (900MHz) | used in Europe |

For deployment in Europe, a dual-band module supporting 900/2100 MHz is required, while for the Americas, a dual-band module supporting 850/1900 MHz is necessary.

It's important to note that 3G/UMTS is also undergoing phase-out by several network operators to accommodate newer technologies.
