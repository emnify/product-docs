### 5G (New Radio)

5G is the next major technology standard following LTE, which targets three main applications areas:

1. Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB)  
    - It offers faster throughput up to 1Gps+ and more capacity in a local areas.
    - It utilizes millimeter-wave (MM wave) bands (5Ghz+) to archieve higher throughput.
1. Massive Machine Type communication (mMTC)  
    - Designed for IoT applications with a multitude of devices in close proximity, requiring low-power communication. 
    - LTE-M and NB-IoT are often seen as decoupled from 5G but may eventually integrate with 5G mMTC.
1. Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communications (URLLC)
    - Aimed at mission-critical applications that demand low latency and reliable data transmission.

As of today, 5G is primarily adopted for eMBB use cases, using a 5G non-standalone (NSA) deployment. That means, that the air interface uses 5G technology whereas the core network remains 4G.

emnify has announced its first 5G roaming agreements in August 2020 and has since reached agreements with more than a dozen network operators worldwide.
