# 4G: LTE/LTE-A/LTE-CATXX

LTE, short for Long-Term Evolution, is a 4G technology (another one would be WiMAX - which never succeeded).
LTE has evolved over time, resulting in various LTE categories, including CAT-1, CAT-3, CAT-4, CAT-6, CAT-9, and CAT-12.
Each successive category delivers higher data throughput compared to its predecessors.

For consumer phones and broadband applications, the increased throughput is significant.
However, the increased module costs prompted the development of lightweight LTE modules tailored for IoT use cases.
This development ultimately led to CAT-1 emerging as the preferred LTE category for IoT applications.
 
LTE CAT-1 offers very impressive data speeds, providing 10Mbps in the downlink and 5Mbps in the uplink.
It is available with network operators wherever LTE is deployed.
Thanks to its widespread availability and the ability to roam between operators without limitations, LTE CAT-1 stands out as the most common choice for IoT use cases.

Deploying LTE devices on a global scale is more challenging compared to GSM and UMTS, primarily because network operators worldwide utilize over 27 different frequency bands.
Consequently, most modules are designed to support specific regions where devices can be deployed effectively.

Some main LTE-bands used are

|  frequency band   |  |
| --- | --- |
| B3 (1800 MHz) | used in Europe, Africa and APAC | 
| B7 (2600 MHz) | used in the Americas, Europe and APAC |
| B20 (800 MHz) | used in Europe and Asia |
| B1 (2100 MHz)  | used in Europe and Asia |
|  B2 (1900 MHz) | used in the Americas |
|  B4 (1700 MHz) | used in the Americas |
| B5 (850 MHz) | used in North America and APAC |

:::tip
Validate the frequency bands utilized by the operators in your deployment countries before deciding on a module.
