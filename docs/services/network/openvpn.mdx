# OpenVPN

import TotpMfaWarningPartial from '../partials/_totp-mfa-warning.mdx'

emnify's communication platform hosts an OpenVPN service that allows you to establish a private network between a device and any remote client location.
The remote client can be on the application server or any machine that wants to access the device remotely (such as operational staff).

## IoT device requirements

Your IoT device doesn't need a private APN, OpenVPN software, or dynamic DNS resolution to use the OpenVPN service.
Through the emnify SIM, each device has a [static](/glossary#static-ip) [private IP address](/glossary#private-ip) that you can use to identify and address the device.

At the same time, the IoT device can send data through the private tunnel to the IP address of the remote machine.
