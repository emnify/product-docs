Using emnify, you can create a [virtual private network (VPN)](/glossary#vpn) for your mobile IoT/M2M devices fitted with emnify SIMs.
Data traffic is exchanged between the devices and the application server through an OpenVPN tunnel, enabling direct communication with the IPs of the mobile devicesâ€”no network address translation (NAT) applied.

The tunnel is established between the emnify Core Network and the customer's VPN gateway or server.
