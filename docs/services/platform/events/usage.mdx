# Work with system events

There are three ways you can access and trigger available events:

- [Data Streamer](#data-streamer)
- [Event API](#event-api)
- [emnify Portal](#emnify-portal)

## Data Streamer

The emnify Data Streamer allows you to configure data streams that capture events generated by the emnify system. These events can include billing-related updates, SIM orders, and other operations performed by your users.

By leveraging our integrations, you gain full network transparency to quickly identify and address issues. Additionally, you can use the provided information to develop your applications or business logic.
These integrations offer valuable insights for IoT remote monitoring, anomaly detection, and detailed service usage data, including data and SMS, as well as cost per device.

:::tip
See the [Data Streamer documentation](/multicloud-data-streamer) to learn more about its benefits and how to get started.
:::

You can manage, inspect, create, update, delete data streams and filter for event data streams using the Portal.
Learn more in the [Data Streamer usage documentation](/multicloud-data-streamer/usage#data-streamer-in-the-portal).

## Event API

The [emnify REST API](/rest) provides a variety of HTTP requests for integrating several emnify services into your application, including the ability to trigger and monitor events.

The [Event API](#retrieve-events-with-the-event-api) specifically allows you to search for recent events and supports various types of result filtering.

:::caution
For events, the emnify REST API uses a [pull architecture](https://dev.to/anubhavitis/push-vs-pull-api-architecture-1djo), which means you're responsible for requesting updates and retrieving new events.
If you prefer real-time updates, consider using the [emnify Data Streamer](#data-streamer).
:::

### Authentication

To use the emnify API, you need to authenticate with an authentication token.
emnify uses JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) for the authentication tokens.

:::tip
The [Getting Started guide in the _emnify REST API Documentation_](https://cdn.emnify.net/api/doc/getting-started.html) provides step-by-step instructions for retrieving your authentication token.
:::

### Specification and documentation

The emnify API is based on the OpenAPI Specification 3.0 (OAS3).
We also offer [interactive API documentation](https://cdn.emnify.net/api/doc/swagger.html).

:::note
Prior OpenAPI knowledge isn't necessary to work with the emnify API.
However, understanding [how an OpenAPI Specification is structured](https://oai.github.io/Documentation/specification.html) could help you navigate the documentation.
:::

The [Events Reference page](https://cdn.emnify.net/api/doc/event.html) in the _emnify REST API Documentation_ provides detailed information about the event structure and common elements you'll encounter while using the Event API.

### Retrieve events with the Event API

You can use the Event API to retrieve a list of events or event types available to your organization or to list events for specific endpoints, SIMs, or users.
These event lists can be further filtered, sorted, and paginated using query parameters:

See this [guide for how to access and manage event data](/system-events/usage-retrieve-events-api).

## emnify Portal

There are several ways to view or trigger events within the [emnify Portal](https://portal.emnify.com/).

### Events in the Portal

Here's where you can find event information in the Portal:

|  Destination  |   Event information  |
| --- | --- |
| [**Dashboard**](https://portal.emnify.com/) | Overview of all event activity within your organization. <br/> <img src={require('./assets/portal-dashboard-events.png').default} alt="" /> |
|  [**Connected Devices**](https://portal.emnify.com/connected-devices)&nbsp;<span aria-label="and then">></span> **Details**&nbsp;<span aria-label="and then">></span> **Events** | List of triggered events for a particular device (also referred to as an "endpoint"). <br/> <img src={require('./assets/portal-connected-devices-details-events.png').default} alt="" /> |
| [**SIM Inventory**](https://portal.emnify.com/sim-inventory)&nbsp;<span aria-label="and then">></span> **Details**&nbsp;<span aria-label="and then">></span> **Events** | List of triggered events for a particular SIM card. <br/> <img src={require('./assets/portal-sim-inventory-details-events.png').default} alt="" /> |

:::info
Any events triggered in the [Portal](https://portal.emnify.com/) shows **API** as the [event source](/system-events#event-source).
:::

### Available data for individual events

Each event has accessible information, such as the severity, date or the event source.
See this [list for all available information for individual events](/system-events/usage-data-available).
