# emnify system events

import Table from '@site/src/components/Table'
import eventSeverityLevels from './data/eventSeverityLevels'
import eventSources from './data/eventSources'

The emnify system generates several types of events.
These events allow you to track notable system occurrences based on behavior and provide information about lifecycle transitions and configuration changes.

## Use cases

Some common use cases for events on emnify include:

- **Triggers for custom business processes** (for example, authentication or custom usage limitations configured on the [emnify Portal](/system-events/usage#emnify-portal))
- **Monitoring** (for example, SIM or data connection lifecycles)
- **Input for custom billing systems** (for example, updating billing configuration or processing invoices)

## Structure

Each event is represented by an object based on the [generic Event Object and its associated properties](https://cdn.emnify.net/api/doc/event.html).

Depending on the event type, some generic properties may not apply, and some events may have additional custom fields to provide information about what happened.

### Event type

For an overview of the specific events generated by our platform, see [Event types](/system-events/event-types).

### Event severity

Events are distinguished by three severity levels:

<Table data={eventSeverityLevels} />

Find more information in the [API reference](https://cdn.emnify.net/api/doc/event.html#event-severity-object).

### Event source

Every event is triggered by one of three available event sources:

<Table data={eventSources} />

:::info
Any events triggered in the [emnify Portal](/system-events/usage#emnify-portal) will show **API** as the event source, because the Portal is an interface that uses the API under the hood.

## Working with events

There are three main ways you can access and trigger events:

- [Data Streamer](/system-events/usage#data-streamer)
- [Event API](/system-events/usage#event-api) 
- [emnify Portal](/system-events/usage#emnify-portal)

More information on these systems and how they compare is available on the [Work with events](/system-events/usage) page.
