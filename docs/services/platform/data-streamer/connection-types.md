# Connection types

The emnify Data Streamer allows you to integrate real-time connectivity data streams of your devices and SIMs into your third-party cloud services and/or business systems.

Using this data, you can build operational dashboards that visualize device, network, and application information side-by-side.

## Available Data Streamer integrations

- [Amazon](/multicloud-data-streamer/integrations#amazon)
- [Azure](/multicloud-data-streamer/integrations#azure)
- [Google Cloud](/multicloud-data-streamer/integrations#google-cloud)
- [Keen](/multicloud-data-streamer/integrations#keen)
- [Datadog](/multicloud-data-streamer/integrations#datadog)
- [Webhook](/multicloud-data-streamer/integrations#webhook) (generic RESTful API)

You can use any integration to create multiple independent data streams and operate them in parallel.
Each data stream can be configured to push data to a separate platform for consumption and processing.

For example, one stream may be connected to a network monitoring system, another can connect to a data analytics platform, and a third can simultaneously sync with S3 for archiving.
