# Roaming

Normally, you will never need to worry about roaming when your IoT devices are moved to another location, even if it is to another country or continent.
Global deployment of IoT devices is a core feature of emnify's [Global IoT Network](/services/global-iot-network).

Unlike typical mobile network operators ([MNO](https://www.emnify.com/iot-glossary/mno)s), emnify works with multiple partner operators across the globe.

If you need more information regarding network coverage in specific countries, please consult your [Customer Success](customer-success) Account Manager who can assist you with any questions you might have.
