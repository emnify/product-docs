# Incident management

Your emnify [customer success](customer-success) team is there for you in the event of an incident. 
Our service-level obligation (SLO) for the **Standard** [service plan](service-plans) is to respond to any type of incident within 7 business days.
However, our SLOs for the **Business** and **Enterprise** plans differentiate between *critical* and *operational* incidents.

Inquiries about subscription plans, services, or other general questions are not considered incidents.
