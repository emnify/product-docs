# Getting started with the emnify Java SDK

## Installation

The emnify Java SDK is open source and the [source code is available on GitHub](https://github.com/EMnify/emnify-sdk-java).

To install the SDK, add the emnify dependency to your existing project and use build automation tools, like Maven or Gradle, or install it manually.

:::caution
Regardless of the package manager you are using, you need to specify the latest version of the emnify Java SDK.
The following installation examples use *`SDK_VERSION`* where this should be specified.
:::


### Prerequisites

#### Supported Java versions

- [OpenJDK 8](https://openjdk.org/projects/jdk8/)
- [OpenJDK 11](https://openjdk.org/projects/jdk/11/)
- [OracleJDK 8](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java8)
- [OracleJDK 11](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java11)

#### TLS requirements

Refer to the [SSL Report table](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=cdn.emnify.net&latest) for the supported Transport Layer Security (TLS) versions.


### Install with Maven

Use the following dependency in your project to grab via [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi):
```xml
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.emnify.sdk</groupId>
        <artifactId>emnify</artifactId>
        <version>SDK_VERSION</version>
    </dependency>
```

Replace *`SDK_VERSION`* with the version of the emnify Java SDK you're using.

### Install with Gradle

Use the following to add the emnify dependency to your project via [Gradle](https://gradle.org/install/):
```gradle
    implementation group: "com.emnify.sdk", name: "emnify", version: "SDK_VERSION"
```

Replace *`SDK_VERSION`* with the version of the emnify Java SDK you're using.

### Install manually

If you want to compile it yourself, here's how:

```shell
    git clone git@github.com:emnify/emnify-sdk-java.git
    cd emnify-sdk-java
    mvn install # Requires Maven
```

If you want to build your own `.jar`, execute the following from within the cloned directory:

```shell
  mvn package
```

## Configuration

### Environment variables

To store configuration settings, like an application token or a base URL, use environment variables instead of hardcoding them in your application.
Here are some examples:

| Name               | Description                                                              |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `EMNIFY_BASE_PATH` | Base URL to form a request. Default value:  `https://cdn.emnify.net` |
| `EMNIFY_APPLICATION_TOKEN`  | Variable for authenticating via an [application token](/rest/authentication#authenticate-with-an-application-token). |
| `EMNIFY_USERNAME` and `EMNIFY_PASSWORD` | Variables for authenticating via [username and password](/rest/authentication#authenticate-with-user-credentials). |
