# emnify SDKs

Software development kits (SDKs) provide access to emnify APIs through logical expressions, reducing the application development cost without sacrificing core functionality.
With emnify SDKs, you can flexibly automate your SIM state management to match the unique lifecycle of your devices, starting with their initial configuration.
Using SDKs also enables you to implement real-time monitoring of your connected devices, troubleshoot connectivity issues, and more.

The following programming languages are available as SDKs:

- [Python](/sdks/python/quickstart)
- [Java](/sdks/java/quickstart)
